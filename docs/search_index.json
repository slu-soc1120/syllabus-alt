Pierre Bourdieu (1996) This course will survey the field of sociology, stressing important ideas, methods, and results. We focus on health to illustrate the application of sociological ideas. The survey is designed to develop analytic thinking skills. Weekly readings from a text will be supplemented with articles and chapters illustrating topical issues and exercises on the skills and craft of the social sciences. "],["course-objectives.html", "1.1 Course Objectives", " 1.1 Course Objectives By the end of the semester, you should be able to: Describe the major theoretical traditions within sociology and the way that we use social theory, and apply these theories to current events. Identify sociological contributions to a number of substantive areas, including urban sociology, crime and deviance, race, class, and gender. Apply core sociological concepts by analyzing data and your own experiences to understand how they reflect fundamental social issues. Integrate core sociological concepts into analyses of population health and health disparities using both fundamental cause theory and the social determinants of health perspective as well as other sociological concepts and data. "],["cultural-diversity-core-requirement.html", "1.2 Cultural Diversity Core Requirement", " 1.2 Cultural Diversity Core Requirement This course fulfills the College of Arts and Sciences core requirement for Cultural Diversity in the United States. The Cultural Diversity in the United States requirement is designed to help students gain a better understanding of the cultural groups in the United States and their interactions. Students who complete a Cultural Diversity course in this category will gain a substantial subset of the following skills: Analyze and evaluate how various underrepresented social groups confront inequality and claim a just place in society. Examine how conflict and cooperation between social groups shapes U.S. society and culture. Identify how individual and institutional forms of discrimination impact leaders, communities and community building through the examination of such factors as race, ethnicity, gender, religion, economic class, age, physical and mental capability, and sexual orientation. Evaluate how their personal life experiences and choices fit within the larger mosaic of U.S. society by confronting and critically analyzing their own values and assumptions about individuals and groups from different cultural contexts. Understand how questions of diversity intersect with moral and political questions of justice and equality.

"],["readings.html", "1.4 Readings", " 1.4 Readings There are two books required for this course. Each book has been selected to correspond with one or more of the course objectives. The books are: Abraham, Laurie K. 2019. Mama Might Be Better Off Dead: The Failure of Health Care in Urban America. Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press. ISBN-13: 978-0226623702; List Price: $20.00; e-book versions available. I do not require students to buy physical copies of Mama Might Be Better Off Dead. You are free to select a means for accessing Mama that meets your budget and learning style. Khan, Shamus, Patrick Sharkey, and Gwen Sharp, eds. A Sociology Experiment; e-book only. This is a unique “textbook” where you purchase it by chapter instead of buying the entire book. Each chapter is written by one or more leading sociologists in the fields that the chapter covers. Each chapter costs $1. If you have a concern about accessing this non-traditional resource, please let me know as soon as possible. I recommend purchasing all of the chapters at once rather than one at a time to reduce any associated credit card fees. Once you purchase a chapter, you will be able to download a .pdf copy of the text to keep. You will need to purchase the following Chapters: All of Part 1- “1 - A Sociology Experiment,” “2 - Research Methods,” and “3- Social Structure and the Individual” All of Part 2 - “4 - Social Class, Inequality, and Poverty,” “5 - Culture,” “6 - Gender and Sexuality,” and “7 - Race and Ethnicity” From Part 3 - “12 - Urban Sociology” and “15 - Health and Illness” Only Mama Might Be Better Off Dead is available through the bookstore! Use this link or the link below to access A Sociology Experiment! All chapters can be purchased through the text’s website. All readings are listed on the Reading List and should be completed before the course meeting on the week in which they are assigned (unless otherwise noted). Many of the readings on the syllabus are peer reviewed journal articles that you’ll be able to access through the library. Being “peer reviewed” means that they are written with an aim to contribute to scientific debates. Their primary audiences are typically health care providers, professors, and graduate students. They are therefore sometimes difficult to read. Give yourself time - I don’t expect each student to fully understanding the intricacies of each article (especially the statistics included in some), but I do expect you to walk away with a general sense of the argument and evidence presented. "],["success-in-soc-1120.html", "1.5 Success in SOC 1120", " 1.5 Success in SOC 1120 Since this course will meet remotely for the entire semester, I have posted several articles on the Course Docs that include suggestions for navigating the course content, using Zoom, and using Canvas. Please review these before the semester begins. Following these will be crucial for having a successful semester! Students often ask me how to do well in various aspects of the course, and so I also have suggestions for a successful semester. These observations are provided with no warranty - following them does not guarantee any particular outcome. You could do everything in here and still do poorly in the course, and conversely you could ignore much of what is in discussed in the links below and still do well. However, most of the students who are successful in this course will follow most of these ideas consistently. Doing the Little Things Right Come to Office Hours! Studying for Quizzes Writing in the Social Sciences Letters of Recommendation - Pay particular to the section titled “If I Say No” if you may want an Instructor Evaluation for medical school - I prioritize letter writing for students who I get to know outside of the classroom. These tips are an effort to illuminate what sociologists refer to as the “hidden curriculum” of higher education - there are things you need to do to be successful, but they are often unstated or not clearly communicated. If there are other topics you have questions about, please let me know. These documents are a work in progress. Part of these documents involve tips for emailing faculty and link to an article with some additional tips. If you send me an email prior to the second lecture that breaks as many rules as possible (but clearly identifies in some way who you are), I’ll give you extra credit. "],["course-policies.html", "Section 2 Course Policies", " Section 2 Course Policies My priority is that class periods are productive learning experiences for all students. In order to foster this type of productive environment, I ask students to follow a few general policies and expectations:1 Work each week to contribute to a positive, supportive, welcoming, and compassionate class environment. Arrive to class on time and stay for the entire class period. Silence all electronic devices before entering the classroom. Do not engage in side conversations. This is disrespectful to the speaker (whether me or a classmate), and can affect the ability of others in the class to learn. Be respectful of your fellow classmates. Do not interrupt when someone is speaking, monopolize the conversation, or belittle the ideas or opinions of others. Complete the assigned readings for each class in advance, and come prepared with discussion points and questions. Follow my best practices for using Zoom and Canvas. The following sections contain additional details about specific course policies related to attendance, participation, electronic device use, student support, academic honesty, and Title IX. These general expectations were adopted from language originally used by Dr. Shelley Kimmelberg.↩︎ "],["covid-19.html", "2.1 COVID-19", " 2.1 COVID-19 We are in the midst of something very few Americans alive today have experienced before to this degree - a pandemic caused by a highly contagious virus called “SARS-CoV-2.” This virus causes an illness called COVID-19. Not since the fall of 1919 have Saint Louis University students begun a semester quite like this one. I think acknowledging that we are all starting from varying places of exhaustion, stress, and anxiety is critical. To that end, I’ve written an open letter to all of you that I ask you to read before our first class. Please, first and foremost, focus on what matters most and practice self care. Please follow SLU’s guidance both for your own health and for maintaining community. If you are living on-campus, please follow all of SLU’s policies for social distancing and mask wearing. These are critical for our collective safety. If you are off campus this semester, please follow them anyway! Again, my biggest priority this semester is your health and well-being. Please reach out if you want to talk about strategies for managing our “new normal,” if you find yourself struggling, or just need someone to vent to. Alternatively, you can reach out to either the University Counseling Center at 314-977-TALK or Campus Ministry at 314-977-2425 or campusministry@slu.edu. 2.1.1 Planning for Disruptions While we are starting the semester with all of you in St. Louis, and I am certainly rooting for a semester where you all are able to remain on-campus through Thanksgiving Break, we should recognize that there may be disruptions. For some of you, you may find yourselves quarantined because of an exposure to someone infected with COVID-19. You may become sick yourselves. Changes both on-campus and in the greater St. Louis community may mean changes to how SLU operates and even whether or not you can continue to remain on-campus. Given that these are not abstract concerns, everything laid out here represents a best case scenario for the semester. We may find ourselves needing to change some course policies, reading and assignment schedules, and even teaching modalities based on the challenges we are confronted with this semester. I ask for your patience and your flexibility if and when we do need to make these changes. For my part, I will do my best to stay in touch with you and communicate clearly how these changes will impact our course. One way that I am proactively preparing for disruptions is to add two “flex days” to the syllabus. I do not have any content planned for October 26 or November 23. If there is a widespread disruption, such as the need for many of you to move off campus, I will use these flex days as a buffer so that we can adjust our course schedule without changing the basic structure of the course. If we are approaching these dates without having had to use them, these will become days off from this course. You should therefore treat all of the course dates as provisional. This is my plan as of August 20, and I may modify it further as we progress through the the semester. If I become sick or a member of my family becomes ill, modifications will likely be required. If another faculty member has to take over teaching my class, there may be changes to course content, teaching modality, and assignments. I will do my best to keep everyone updated in a timely fashion. Please check your email and Canvas regularly. I appreciate everyone’s willingness to roll with the many punches we are all facing right now. Remember, we are in this together. 2.1.2 Face Masks Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, key safeguards like face masks have allowed SLU to safely maintain in-person learning. If public health conditions and local, state, and federal restrictions demand it, the University may require that all members of our campus community wear face masks indoors. Therefore, any time a University-level face mask requirement is in effect, face masks will be required in this class. This expectation will apply to all students and instructors, unless a medical condition warrants an exemption from the face mask requirement (see below). When a University-wide face mask requirement is in effect, the following will apply: Students who attempt to enter a classroom without wearing masks will be asked by the instructor to put on their masks prior to entry. Students who remove their masks during a class session will be asked by the instructor to resume wearing their masks. Students and instructors may remove their masks briefly to take a sip of water but should replace masks immediately. The consumption of food will not be permitted. Students who do not comply with the expectation that they wear a mask in accordance with the University-wide face mask requirement may be subject to disciplinary actions per the rules, regulations, and policies of Saint Louis University, including but not limited to those outlined in the Student Handbook. Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including any of the following: dismissal from the course(s) removal from campus housing (if applicable) dismissal from the University To immediately protect the health and well-being of all students, instructors, and staff, instructors reserve the right to cancel or terminate any class session at which any student fails to comply with a University-wide face mask requirement. When a University-wide face mask requirement is in effect, students and instructors may choose to wear a face mask or not, as they prefer for their own individual comfort level. 2.1.2.1 ADA Accomodations for Face Mask Requirements Saint Louis University is committed to maintaining an inclusive and accessible environment. Individuals who are unable to wear a face mask due to medical reasons should contact the Office of Disability Services (students) or Human Resources (instructors) to initiate the accommodation process identified in the University’s ADA Policy. Inquiries or concerns may also be directed to the Office of Institutional Equity and Diversity. Notification to instructors of SLU-approved ADA accommodations should be made in writing prior to the first class session in any term (or as soon thereafter as possible). 2.1.3 Attendance Policies The health and well-being of SLU’s students, staff, and faculty are critical concerns, as is the quality of our learning environments. Accordingly, the following University policy statements on in-person class attendance are designed to preserve and advance the collective health and well-being of our institutional constituencies and to create the conditions in which all students have the opportunity to learn and successfully complete their courses. Students who exhibit any potential COVID-19 symptoms (those that cannot be attributed to some other medical condition the students are known to have, such as allergies, asthma, etc.) shall absent themselves from any in-person class attendance or in-person participation in any class-related activity until they have been evaluated by a qualified medical official. Students should contact the University Student Health Center for immediate assistance. Students (whether exhibiting any of potential COVID-19 symptoms or not, and regardless of how they feel) who are under either an isolation or quarantine directive issued by a qualified health official must absent themselves from all in-person course activities per the stipulations of the isolation or quarantine directive. Students are responsible for notifying their instructor of an absence as far in advance as possible; when advance notification is not possible, students are responsible for notifying each instructor as soon after the absence as possible. Consistent with the University Attendance Policy, students also are responsible for all material covered in class and must work with the instructor to complete any required work. In situations where students must be absent for an extended period of time due to COVID-19 isolation or quarantine, they also must work with the instructor to determine the best way to maintain progress in the course as they are able based on their health situation. Consistent with the University Attendance Policy, students may be asked to provide medical documentation when a medical condition impacts a student’s ability to attend and/or participate in class for an extended period of time. As a temporary amendment to the current University Attendance Policy, all absences due to illness or an isolation/quarantine directive issued by a qualified health official, or due to an adverse reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine, shall be considered “Authorized” absences. 2.1.4 Seating Policy In order to facilitate contact tracing, the University is requiring that we record where students sit each day of class. In order to reduce the burden of this on all of us, I will ask that you sit in the same space for each class section. For the first three course meetings, I will ask students to sign-in not just for attendance purposes, but for seating location purposes as well. After the third course meeting, I will ask you to not switch seats for the remainder of the semester. If you need to change seating for any reason during the remainder of the semester, please speak with me first. When we have our Mama discussions, I will ask each group to fill out an individual seating chart to facilitate contact tracing. I recognize that this is an added burden for all of us, and appreciate your cooperation with it. 2.1.5 Zoom Policies This section of the syllabus will only apply if we switch to having class remotely. If we have to meet via Zoom, there will be several additional policies to note: Attending via Zoom is required. There is not an alternative means for completing this course. If you have a concern about technology, internet access, or other barriers to regularly attending class via Zoom, please let me know as soon as possible. If there is a need for some or all of you to change from learning on-campus to learning from home or another location, we will work together to identify strategies for you to successfully complete the course. Do not share Zoom details, including login information, links, and passwords, with anyone outside of this course. Using your camera is strongly encouraged during group discussions, but is not otherwise required. Please keep your microphone muted unless you are actively speaking. Class recordings will be made via Zoom and/or Panopto, and will be posted to Canvas. Recordings should not be shared outside of class. They will capture whatever is happening on my screen, which may include sharing your name and whatever is actively shown via your webcam. If this presents a privacy concern for you, please let me know as soon as possible. The Course Docs contain some additional tips for using Zoom. Please review them closely. "],["attendance-and-participation.html", "2.2 Attendance and Participation", " 2.2 Attendance and Participation 2.2.1 General Attendance Policy Attendance and participation are important components of this course. Your expected to attend all class sessions and to arrive before the beginning of class. That said, it is important to recognize that our normal attendance policies are not well suited to a pandemic. If you cannot attend class or arrive on time because of a personal illness, a family issue, jury duty, an athletic match, or a religious observance, you must contact me beforehand to let me know if at all possible. I define family issues broadly - if your family or friends become sick or are being affected by COVID-19 in other ways, please know that I want you to keep your focus on what is most important. I may ask for more information, such as a note from a health care provider, a travel letter from Athletics, or other documentation for absences. I will not be asking for health care provider documentation for acute illnesses or injuries, though, since if you’re sick but not very sick, the last thing most you will want to do is go to a doctor just to get a note. I am proceeding with a spirit of trust in all of you, and ask you reciprocate that with me. If you need to modify assignment due dates, please let me know prior to those deadlines. Please see the University’s attendance policy for additional details. 2.2.2 Attendace Collection In order to help identify students who might need extra support, I do keep track of who attends class. Attendance check-ins will be collected through a simple web-form. Students will need a QR code reader application installed on their smartphone to check-in if their phone does not support it automatically. The Course Docs contain some additional details and links for learning more about how this works. This QR code will be available as print-outs in the back and front of the classroom. Please scan them as you come into class. Attendance submissions must be received by the end of the class period. These web forms are time stamped, so if you sign the form 3 minutes after the beginning of class or later, you will be marked as ‘late’ in the attendance database. This is done automatically by my gradebook, so please see me if you have a concern about how this works or, more generally, if you have a concern about regularly being able to arrive to class on time. If you do not own a smartphone, please let me know as soon as possible. You should note that attendance check-ins are covered by the course’s Academic Honesty policy. Sharing the check-in form with another student or signing in on their behalf are both violations of this policy. If we have to switch to having class remotely, the QR code will be available on-screen. This means that you need to arrive to class at least a minute or two before we begin. If you arrive after the QR code has been taken down, I’ll put it up again at the end of the “front matter” and “back matter” sections of the lecture slides. Attendance submissions must be received by the end of the class period. 2.2.3 Missed Classes My priority with attendance is to identify students who may be struggling or in need of additional support. However, because attending class is crucial, I do factor attendance into your overall participation grade. In order to give you some flexibility, I do not apply any penalties to your first two unexcused absences. Any unexcused absences beyond those two will result in no credit (for an absences). Regular late arrivals may result in partial credit being earned for that day’s participation grade. Specific elements of the course, such as participation in group discussions during lectures as well as the QHQ discussions, will also be factored into your participation grade. If there is a need for you to miss a significant portion of your coursework, such as because of an illness, please reach out to me and we will make a plan for alternative ways to make-up these activities based on the circumstances. It is your responsibility to make-up missed classes, including viewing the lecture recording and, if needed, obtaining notes from a classmate All lecture slides will be posted on Canvas before class begins along with relevant notes for that lecture. Please note that lectures and discussions cannot be recorded by any means (e.g. audio or video recordings, or photographs) without my permission. "],["communication.html", "2.3 Communication", " 2.3 Communication The best ways to get in touch with me are email, texting, or calling: Email - chris.prener@slu.edu Text or call - 314-884-0386 Email is my preferred method of communication. I dedicate time to email responses each workday, meaning that my response time is typically within 24 hours during the workweek. If you have not received a response from me after 48 hours (or by end of business on Monday if you emailed me over the weekend), please feel free to follow-up with me. Please use your SLU email account when emailing me. All messages regarding course updates, assignments, and changes to the class schedule including cancellations will be sent to your SLU email account. It is therefore imperative that you check your SLU email account regularly. I also have a new way to contact me - I don’t have an office land-line anymore, but I do have a Google Voice number that students can use to text or call me. If you do call or text, please let me know who you are and what section you are in! I’ll respond to calls or texts during the workweek, just like with email. Please also ensure that all concerns or questions about your standing in the course are directed to me immediately. Inquires from parents, SLU staff members, and others will not be honored. "],["electronic-devices.html", "2.4 Electronic Devices", " 2.4 Electronic Devices During class periods, students are asked to refrain from using electronic devices (including cell phones) for activities not directly related to the course. For this class, I expect students to limit their use of electronic devices to accessing Zoom, course readings, notes, and other course materials. There is evidence that using electronic devices during lectures results in decreased retention of course content (Hembrooke and Gay 2003) and lower overall course performance (Fried 2008). Students who are not using a laptop but are in direct view of another student’s laptop also have decreased performance in courses (Sana et al. 2013). Conversely, students who take notes the “old fashioned way” have better performance on tests compared to students who take notes on laptops (Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014). I therefore ask students to be conscious of how they are using their devices, the ways such use impacts their own learning, and the effect that it may have on others around them. I reserve the right to alter this policy if electronic device use becomes problematic during the semester. "],["student-support.html", "2.5 Student Support", " 2.5 Student Support 2.5.1 Basic Needs If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or lack a safe and stable place to live, you are urged to contact the Dean of Students for support. Likewise if you have concerns about your mental or physical health needs, or lack access to health care services you require, you should contact either the Dean of Students, Student Health Services, or the University Counseling Center.2 If you feel comfortable doing so, please discuss any concerns you might have with me. Doing so is particularly important if believe your performance in this course might be affected. I will do my best to work with you to come up with a plan for successfully completing the course and, if need be, work with you to identify on-campus resources. I will treat all discussions with discretion, though please be aware that certain situations, including disclosures of sexual misconduct or self harm, must be reported by faculty to the appropriate University office. 2.5.2 Academic Accommodations If you meet the eligibility requirements for academic accommodations through the Office of Disability Services (located within the Student Success Center) and you wish to use them for this class, you should arrange to discuss your needs with me after the first class. All discussions of this nature are treated confidentially, and I will make every effort to work with you to come up with a plan for successfully completing the course requirements. Please note that I will not provide accommodations to students who are not working with Disability Services, and that I cannot retroactively alter assignments or grades if they have already been completed. This follows the University policies on disability accommodations: Students with a documented disability who wish to request academic accommodations must formally register their disability with the University. Once successfully registered, students also must notify their course instructor that they wish to use their approved accommodations in the course. Please contact Disability Services to schedule an appointment to discuss accommodation requests and eligibility requirements. Most students on the St. Louis campus will contact Disability Services, located in the Student Success Center and available by email at Disability_services@slu.edu or by phone at 314-977-3484. Once approved, information about a student’s eligibility for academic accommodations will be shared with course instructors by email from Disability Services and within the instructor’s official course roster. Students who do not have a documented disability but who think they may have one also are encouraged to contact to Disability Services. Confidentiality will be observed in all inquiries. 2.5.3 Writing Services I also encourage you to take advantage of the University Writing Services (UWS) program. Getting feedback benefits writers at all skill levels and the quality of your writing will be reflected in assignment grades. The UWS has trained writing consultants who can help you improve the quality of your written work. UWS’s consultants are available to address everything from brainstorming and developing ideas to crafting strong sentences and documenting sources. 2.5.4 Student Success Coaching Academic coaches are staff members who can assist with study skills, time management, test and note taking, goal setting, and motivations. They can also help deal with navigating homesickness, making connections on campus, and being successful in online/remote coursework. Coaches will work with you on a weekly basis to develop the skills that are most important to you. For more information, please contact Emily Tuttle.

The mission of Saint Louis University is “the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity.” Accordingly, all acts of falsehood demean and compromise the corporate endeavors of teaching, research, health care, and community service through which SLU fulfills its mission. The University strives to prepare students for lives of personal and professional integrity, and therefore regards all breaches of academic integrity as matters of serious concern. Any work that is taken from another student, copied from printed material, or copied the internet without proper citation is expressly prohibited, and will be addressed by the instructor. Collaborating on quizzes, such as taking them in groups (whether in-person or virtually), is also prohibited. Any student who is found to have been academically dishonest in their work risks failing both the assignment and this course. All relevant assignments should include in-text citations and references formatted using the American Sociological Association (ASA) style guidelines.

Students should generally be aware that: Saint Louis University prohibits harassment because of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status, military status, veteran status, gender expression/identity, genetic information, pregnancy, or any other characteristics protected by law. All students should also familiarize themselves with Saint Louis University’s polices on bias, discrimination, harassment, and sexual misconduct. In particular, they should be aware of policies on harassment and sexual misconduct: Saint Louis University and its faculty are committed to supporting our students and seeking an environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment. If you have encountered any form of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, stalking, domestic or dating violence, we encourage you to report this to the University. If you speak with a faculty member about an incident that involves a Title IX matter, that faculty member must notify SLU’s Title IX Coordinator and share the basic facts of your experience. This is true even if you ask the faculty member not to disclose the incident. The Title IX Coordinator will then be available to assist you in understanding all of your options and in connecting you with all possible resources on and off campus. Anna Kratky is the Title IX Coordinator at Saint Louis University (DuBourg Hall, Room 36; anna.kratky@slu.edu; 314-977-3886).

"],["assignments.html", "3.1 Assignments", " 3.1 Assignments Your grade for this course will consist of a number of different assignments on which points may be earned. Each category of assignment is described below. As a reminder, all due dates are provisional due to the uncertainty around COVID-19 and how it will affect our semester. I will continually update you during class and via Canvas about the status of each assignment’s due dates as the semester progresses. 3.1.1 Attendance and Participation Attendance and participation are worth 95 points, or 16.1% of your final grade As discussed above, both attendance and participation are important aspects of this class. The class participation grade will be based on (a) attendance, (b) level of engagement during class (including being present for and participating in course discussions), and (c) class “entry” and “exit tickets.” Each of these elements is assigned a point value and assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit (see Grading). Not attending class or completing an “entry” or “exit” ticket will result in no credit being earned for that element on a given day. Disengagement during class may result in partial or no credit being earned. Late arrivals will result in only partial credit earned for that element on a given day. Your participation grade will be split, with 20 points for Part 1, 30 points each for Parts 2 and 3, and 15 points for Part 4. Since the number of points awarded for participation are variable, the total number of points earned for each half will be weighted so that it is converted to a final score that matches the points available for that part of the course. I provide the final number of points earned for each part of the course. If you would like a more detailed breakdown of your participation grade and/or attendance record, please reach out and I will happily provide one. 3.1.2 Theory Isn’t Dead Posts Theory posts are worth 40 points, or 6.8% of your final grade Over the course of the semester, there will be four short exercises that ask you to tie social theory, social science research, and current events together. For each of these assignments, I will post a news article. Based on your read of the article, you should pick one of the social theories we have discussed in class or in readings, briefly describe why you selected that theory (in 2-3 sentences), and then craft a theoretically motivated research question and hypothesis (a sentence each). Finally, you will briefly describe how you would propose to study this hypothesis (in 2-3 sentences). Your assignments will be posted to Canvas before 5pm on the due date. Additional details and a sample assignment will be made available via Canvas. Each Theory Post is worth 20 points. Both elements will be assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit (see Grading). Due dates for the Theory Post are as follows: Theory Isn’t Dead 1 - Thursday, September 9 Theory Isn’t Dead 2 - Tuesday, October 5 3.1.3 Sociological Experiences Theory reflections are worth 80 points, or 13.6% of your final grade Over the course of the semester, there will be four short exercises that ask you to link data to your own personal experiences. Data for these exercises will be drawn primarily from Social Explorer, a tool that makes it easy to find demographic data about various places in the United States. These reflections should be approximately 1-2 paragraphs in length. Additional details and a sample assignment will be made available via Canvas. Each Sociological Experience is worth 20 points, and will be assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit (see Grading). Assignments are due by the beginning of class on the due date. Due dates for the Sociological Experiences are as follows: Sociological Experience 1 - High School - Tuesday, September 21 Sociological Experience 2 - Socioeconomic Status - Tuesday, October 12 Sociological Experience 3 - Segregation - Thursday, November 11 Sociological Experience 4 - St. Louis - Thursday, December 2 3.1.4 Mama Papers QHQ Papers are worth 150 points, or 25.4% of your final grade Each student will write a reflection paper on three chapters (one chapter per discussion period) of Mama Might Be Better Off Dead (Abraham 1993). These reflection papers will integrate previous lecture material and readings to understand the cycle of events described in the book. Additional details and a grading rubric will be available on Canvas. Papers must be completed and submitted by the beginning of class on the date due. Each paper is worth 50 points. Due dates for the QHQs are as follows: Mama Paper 1 - Thursday, October 14 Mama Paper 2 - Thursday, November 18 Mama Paper 3 - Tuesday, December 7 3.1.5 Quizzes Quizzes are worth 150 points, or 25.4% of your final grade Three non-cumulative multiple choice quizzes will be given throughout the semester. Each quiz will cover the breadth of the material in the course, including readings, lectures, and videos. Each quiz will consist of 30 multiple choice questions and will be worth 50 points. They will be administered via Canvas. Quizzes must be taken between 7am CST and 10pm CST on the quiz date. They can be started at any point within that range, but once you begin the quiz, you will have only 45 minutes to complete it. Since they occur remotely, quizzes are open book and note. Quiz dates are as follows: Quiz 1 - Monday, September 27 Quiz 2 - Monday, October 25 Quiz 3 - Tuesday, December 14 This is overlaps with our scheduled final exam time, so you can take the quiz during that period if you wish. 3.1.6 Final Project The Final Project is worth 75 points, or 12.7% of your final grade This project involves the creation of a single page handout that illustrates the origins of a health disparity present in American society. On the handout, you should provide some background information, data about the disparity, and connect the disparity to fundamental cause theory and/or the social determinants of health perspective. You have creative license to design the handout as you see fit, and should feel free to add graphs, maps, or photographs that help you illustrate the issues you are describing. The second page of the handout should contain a list of works cited. More details and a rubric will be provided on Canvas. The final project will be due by Tuesday, December 14. "],["submission-and-late-work.html", "3.2 Submission and Late Work", " 3.2 Submission and Late Work 3.2.1 Canvas Submissions All assignments must be submitted via Canvas as a .pdf file unless otherwise noted in the assignment instructions. Feedback will be returned to students via comments embedded in each document. 3.2.2 Late Work Once the due date has passed, any assignments shared will be treated as late. Be advised that Canvas time-stamps submissions, so that even being a few seconds over the due date and time will result in your assignment being marked late. Like arriving late to class, this happens automatically, so please let me know as soon as possible before a due date if you have a concern about a potentially late submission. Assignments shared within 24-hours of the due date will have 15% deducted from the grade. I will deduct 15% per day for the next two 24-hour periods that assignments are late; after 72-hours, I will not accept late work. If you cannot submit work on time because of a personal illness, a family issue, jury duty, an athletic match, or a religious observance, you must contact me beforehand if at all possible to discuss alternate submission of work. I may ask for more information, such as a note from a physician, a travel letter from Athletics, or other documentation for alternative deadlines. 3.2.3 Missed Quizzes If you cannot attend an exam due to a personal illness, a family issue, jury duty, an athletic match, or a religious observance, you must contact me beforehand to discuss alternate quiz scheduling. I may ask for more information, such as a note from a physician, a travel letter from Athletics, or other documentation for rescheduled quizzes. "],["extra-credit.html", "3.3 Extra Credit", " 3.3 Extra Credit From time to time I may offer extra credit to be applied to your final grade. I will only offer extra credit if it is open to the entire class (typically for something like attending a lecture or event on-campus). If I offer extra credit, I will generally require you to submit a short written summary of the activity within a week of the event to obtain the credit. Papers should be submitted via Canvas and will typically consist of a paragraph describing the event and a paragraph connecting the event to the class material in some way. When offered, extra credit opportunities cannot be made-up or substituted if you are unable to attend the event. "],["grading.html", "3.4 Grading", " 3.4 Grading All grades that use a “check” system (the Theory Isn’t Dead and Sociological Experience assignments as well as “entry” and “exit” tickets) will be calculated using the following approach. A “check-plus-plus” represents exceptional work and will get full credit. A “check-plus” represents great work and will get 92% of the points available for the assignment. A “check” represents satisfactory work and will get 85% of the points available for that assignment. A “check-minus” represents work that needs substantial improvement and will get 75% of the points available for that assignment. For other assignments, rubrics will be provided prior to the due date that break down how grading works. I use a point system for calculating grades. The following table gives the weighting and final point totals for all assignments for this course: Table 3.1: SOC 1120 Points Breakdown Assignment Period Points Quantity Total Percent Participation Part 1 20 pts x1 20 pts 16.1% Part 2 30 pts x1 30 pts Part 3 30 pts x1 30 pts Part 4 15 pts x1 15 pts Theory Isn’t Dead 20 pts x2 40 pts 6.8% Sociological Experiences 20 pts x4 80 pts 13.6% QHQs 75 pts x2 150 pts 25.4% Quizzes 50 pts x3 150 pts 25.4% Final Project 75 pts x1 75 pts 12.7% All feedback will include grades that represent number of points earned. If you want to know your percentage on a particular assignment, divide the number of points earned by the number of points possible and then multiply it by 100. Some of the provided rubrics on Canvas result in final points for assignments that include decimals. In the event of non-standard decimals (those other than .25, .5, or .75), I will round your grade up to the next standard decimal value (e.g. .25, .5, or .75). 3.4.1 Conflicting or Incorrect Grades If you notice a discrepancy between the grade you received in the feedback and what appears on Canvas, please let me know as soon as possible. I will default to taking the higher of the two grades as the official grade. 3.4.2 Letter Grades Letter grades will be calculated by taking the sum of all points earned and dividing it by the total number of points possible. This will be multiplied by 100 and then converted to a letter grade using the following table: Table 3.2: Course Grading Scale GPA Letter Percent 4.0 A 93.0% - 100% 3.7 A- 90.0% - 92.9% 3.3 B+ 87.0% - 89.9% 3.0 B 83.0% - 86.9% 2.7 B- 80.0% - 82.9% GPA Letter Percent 2.3 C+ 77.0% - 79.9% 2.0 C 73.0% - 76.9% 1.7 C- 70.0% - 72.9% 1.0 D 63.0% - 69.9% 0.0 F &lt; 63.0% Updates to grades will be provided at midterms, and you can follow your progress via the My Grades area on Canvas. I round-up final grades that are within a half percentage point of the next highest letter grade. Requests for final grade changes outside of this range will not be honored. No chances will be given for revisions of poor grades. Incomplete grades will be given upon request only if you have a “C” average and have completed at least two-thirds of the possible points (412 points). You should note that incomplete grades must be rectified by the specified deadline or they convert to an “F”. This policy reflects the University’s policy on incomplete coursework.
