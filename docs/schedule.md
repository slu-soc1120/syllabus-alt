### Scheduling Notes

The course schedule may change as it depends on the progress of the class and the [challenges we are confronted by this semester](covid-19.html). The web version of this document will be updated to reflect any alterations, but the `.pdf` version will remain unaltered.

This semester, we will not have class on **October 28** and **November 25** because they fall on University breaks. Additionally, no class activities are scheduled for **October 26** or **November 23**. These are "flex days," which I have left without a scheduled plan to accommodate changes due to COVID-19. If we are approaching these dates without having had to use them, these will become days off from this course.
