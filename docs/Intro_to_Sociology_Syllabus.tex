This is the hardcopy version of the \textbf{Fall 2020} syllabus.
\vspace{5mm}
\par \noindent This \texttt{.pdf} version of the course syllabus is automatically created as part of the document generation process. It is meant for students who wish to keep a hardcopy of the course policies and planned course schedule. \textbf{Since it is automatically created, it is not optimized for easy use} - readers may notice formatting inconsitencies and stray characters that are a result of the markdown to \LaTeX{} conversion process. The web version (located at \href{https://slu-soc1120.github/syllabus/}{https://slu-soc1120.github/syllabus-alt/}) is meant to be the version of the syllabus used for everyday reference during the semester. As such, this \texttt{.pdf} version will not be updated as the semester progresses should any changes to the course schedule be necessary.

\hypertarget{course-introduction}{%
\chapter{Course Introduction}\label{course-introduction}}

\begin{quote}
The function of sociology, as of every science, is to reveal that which is hidden.
\end{quote}

\textbf{Pierre Bourdieu (1996)}

This course will survey the field of sociology, stressing important ideas, methods, and results. We focus on health to illustrate the application of sociological ideas. The survey is designed to develop analytic thinking skills. Weekly readings from a text will be supplemented with articles and chapters illustrating topical issues and exercises on the skills and craft of the social sciences.

\hypertarget{course-objectives}{%
\section{Course Objectives}\label{course-objectives}}

By the \emph{end} of the semester, you should be able to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Describe the major theoretical traditions within sociology and the way that we use social theory, and apply these theories to current events.
\item
  Identify sociological contributions to a number of substantive areas, including urban sociology, crime and deviance, race, class, and gender.
\item
  Apply core sociological concepts by analyzing data and your own experiences to understand how they reflect fundamental social issues.
\item
  Integrate core sociological concepts into analyses of population health and health disparities using both fundamental cause theory and the social determinants of health perspective as well as other sociological concepts and data.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{cultural-diversity-core-requirement}{%
\section{Cultural Diversity Core Requirement}\label{cultural-diversity-core-requirement}}

This course fulfills the College of Arts and Sciences core requirement for Cultural Diversity in the United States. The Cultural Diversity in the United States requirement is designed to help students gain a better understanding of the cultural groups in the United States and their interactions. Students who complete a Cultural Diversity course in this category will gain a substantial subset of the following skills:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Analyze and evaluate how various underrepresented social groups confront inequality and claim a just place in society.
\item
  Examine how conflict and cooperation between social groups shapes U.S. society and culture.
\item
  Identify how individual and institutional forms of discrimination impact leaders, communities and community building through the examination of such factors as race, ethnicity, gender, religion, economic class, age, physical and mental capability, and sexual orientation.
\item
  Evaluate how their personal life experiences and choices fit within the larger mosaic of U.S. society by confronting and critically analyzing their own values and assumptions about individuals and groups from different cultural contexts.
\item
  Understand how questions of diversity intersect with moral and political questions of justice and equality.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{blackboard}{%
\section{Blackboard}\label{blackboard}}

\textbf{Blackboard} is a learning management system similar to Google Classroom and Canvas. There are two main areas - the \texttt{Annoucements} page and the various ``modules'' that contain course content. The \texttt{Annoucements} contains posts for announcements and assignments. Additions to the \texttt{Annoucements} should be emailed to your student e-mail account automatically. This will be my primary means for communicating with the class as a whole. Assignments posted to the various modules will allow you to submit work for the course.

\hypertarget{readings}{%
\section{Readings}\label{readings}}

There are two books required for this course. Each book has been selected to correspond with one or more of the course objectives. The books are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Abraham, Laurie K. 2019. \emph{Mama Might Be Better Off Dead: The Failure of Health Care in Urban America}. Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press. ISBN-13: 978-0226623702; List Price: \$20.00; e-book versions available.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    I do not require students to buy physical copies of \emph{Mama Might Be Better Off Dead.} You are free to select a means for accessing \emph{Mama} that meets your budget and learning style.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Khan, Shamus, Patrick Sharkey, and Gwen Sharp, eds.~\emph{A Sociology Experiment}; e-book only.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This is a unique ``textbook'' where you purchase it by chapter instead of buying the entire book. Each chapter is written by one or more leading sociologists in the fields that the chapter covers. Each chapter costs \$1. If you have a concern about accessing this non-traditional resource, please let me know as soon as possible.
  \item
    Once you purchase a chapter, you will be able to download a \texttt{.pdf} copy of the text to keep.
  \item
    You will need to purchase the following Chapters:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      All of Part 1- ``1 - A Sociology Experiment,'' ``2 - Research Methods,'' and ``3- Social Structure and the Individual''
    \item
      All of Part 2 - ``4 - Social Class, Inequality, and Poverty,'' ``5 - Culture,'' ``6 - Gender and Sexuality,'' and ``7 - Race and Ethnicity''
    \item
      From Part 3 - ``12 - Urban Sociology'' and ``15 - Health and Illness''
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{rmdwarning}
Only \emph{Mama Might Be Better Off Dead} is available through the
bookstore! Use this link or the link below to access \emph{A Sociology
Experiment}! All chapters can be purchased through the text's website.
\end{rmdwarning}

All readings are listed on the \href{/syllabus/lecture-schedule.html}{\textbf{Reading List}} and should be completed before the course meeting on the week in which they are assigned (unless otherwise noted).

Many of the readings on the syllabus are peer reviewed journal articles that you'll be able to access through the library. Being ``peer reviewed'' means that they are written with an aim to contribute to scientific debates. Their primary audiences are typically health care providers, professors, and graduate students. They are therefore sometimes \emph{difficult} to read. Give yourself time - I don't expect each student to fully understanding the intricacies of each article (especially the statistics included in some), but I do expect you to walk away with a general sense of the argument and evidence presented.

\hypertarget{course-policies}{%
\chapter{Course Policies}\label{course-policies}}

My priority is that class periods are productive learning experiences for all students. In order to foster this type of productive environment, I ask students to follow a few general policies and expectations:\footnote{These general expectations were adopted from language originally used by Dr.~Shelley Kimmelberg.}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Work each week to contribute to a positive, supportive, welcoming, and compassionate class environment.
\item
  Arrive to class on time and stay for the entire class period.
\item
  Silence \emph{all} electronic devices before entering the classroom.
\item
  Do not engage in side conversations. This is disrespectful to the speaker (whether me or a classmate), and can affect the ability of others in the class to learn.
\item
  Be respectful of your fellow classmates. Do not interrupt when someone is speaking, monopolize the conversation, or belittle the ideas or opinions of others.
\item
  Complete the assigned readings for each class in advance, and come prepared with discussion points and questions.
\item
  Follow my best practices for using Zoom and Blackboard.
\end{enumerate}

The following sections contain additional details about specific course policies related to attendance, participation, electronic device use, student support, academic honesty, and Title IX.

\hypertarget{covid-19}{%
\section{COVID-19}\label{covid-19}}

We are in the midst of something very few Americans alive today have experienced before to this degree - a pandemic caused by a highly contagious virus called ``SARS-CoV-2.'' This virus causes an illness called COVID-19. Not since the fall of 1919 have Saint Louis University students begun a semester quite like this one. I think acknowledging that we are all starting from varying places of exhaustion, stress, and anxiety is critical. To that end, I've written an open letter to all of you that I ask you to read before our first class.

Please, first and foremost, focus on what matters most and practice self care. Please follow SLU's guidance both for your own health and for maintaining community. If you are living on-campus, please follow all of SLU's policies for social distancing and mask wearing. These are critical for our collective safety. If you are off campus this semester, please follow them anyway!

Again, my biggest priority this semester is your health and well-being. Please reach out if you want to talk about strategies for managing our ``new normal,'' if you find yourself struggling, or just need someone to vent to. Alternatively, you can reach out to either the University Counseling Center at 314-977-TALK or Campus Ministry at 314-977-2425 or \href{mailto:campusministry@slu.edu}{\nolinkurl{campusministry@slu.edu}}.

\hypertarget{planning-for-disruptions}{%
\subsection{Planning for Disruptions}\label{planning-for-disruptions}}

While we are starting the semester with many of you in St.~Louis, and I am certainly rooting for a semester where you all are able to remain on-campus through Thanksgiving Break, we should recognize that there may be disruptions. For some of you, you may find yourselves quarantined because of an exposure to someone infected with COVID-19. You may become sick yourselves. Changes both on-campus and in the greater St.~Louis community may mean changes to how SLU operates and even whether or not you can continue to remain on-campus.

Given that these are not abstract concerns, everything laid out here represents a best case scenario for the semester. We may find ourselves needing to change some course policies, reading and assignment schedules, and even teaching modalities based on the challenges we are confronted with this semester. I ask for your patience and your flexibility if and when we do need to make these changes. For my part, I will do my best to stay in touch with you and communicate clearly how these changes will impact our course.

One way that I am proactively preparing for disruptions is to add two \textbf{``flex days''} to the syllabus. I do not have any content planned for \textbf{October 22\textsuperscript{nd}} or \textbf{November 24\textsuperscript{th}}. If there is a widespread disruption, such as the need for many of you to move off campus, I will use these flex days as a buffer so that we can adjust our course schedule without changing the basic structure of the course. If we are approaching these dates without having had to use them, I will communicate my plans for both days with you all so that you can plan your time accordingly.

\textbf{You should therefore treat all of the course dates as provisional.} This is my plan as of August 14\textsuperscript{th}, and I may modify it further as we progress through the the semester. If I become sick or a member of my family becomes ill, modifications will likely be required. If another faculty member has to take over teaching my class, there may be changes to course content, teaching modality, and assignments. I will do my best to keep everyone updated in a timely fashion. Please check your email and Blackboard regularly. I appreciate everyone's willingness to roll with the many punches we are all facing right now. Remember, we are in this together.

\hypertarget{face-masks}{%
\subsection{Face Masks}\label{face-masks}}

Since we are meeting virtually, I hope that our class meetings are able to be more relaxed than an in-person course, where face masks and social distancing will be ever present. If you do decide to meet-up with classmates in-person to study for a quiz or work on coursework, it is imperative that you follow SLU's policies for social distancing and mask wearing.

The University's Interim Policy on Face Masks governs all students, faculty, staff, and campus visitors in all University-owned, leased, or operated facilities. All persons physically present in any such University facility associated with this course shall comply fully with this policy at all times. Masks must be worn before entry to all such University facilities (as well as outdoors on all University property when six feet of distance is unpredictable or cannot be maintained).

Saint Louis University is committed to maintaining an inclusive and accessible environment. Individuals who are unable to wear a face mask due to medical reasons should contact the Office of Disability Services or Human Resources to initiate the accommodation process identified in the University's ADA Policy. Inquires or concerns may also be directed to the Office of Institutional Equity and Diversity. Notification to instructors of SLU-approved ADA accommodations should be made in writing prior to the first class session in any term (or as soon thereafter as possible).

As the instructor of this course, I shall comply fully with SLU's policy and all related ADA regulations.

Students who do not comply with a request by a SLU instructor to wear a mask in accordance with the University's Interim Policy on Face Masks may be subject to disciplinary actions per the rules, regulations, and policies of Saint Louis University, including but not limited to the Student Handbook. Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including any of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  dismissal from the course(s)
\item
  removal from campus housing (if applicable)
\item
  dismissal from the University
\end{itemize}

Students are strongly encouraged to identify to their instructor any student or instructor not in compliance. Non-compliance may be anonymously reported via the SLU Integrity Hotline at 1-877-525-5669 (or confidentially via the Integrity Hotline's website.

\hypertarget{attendance-and-participation}{%
\section{Attendance and Participation}\label{attendance-and-participation}}

\hypertarget{general-attendance-policy}{%
\subsection{General Attendance Policy}\label{general-attendance-policy}}

Attendance and participation are important components of this course. Your expected to attend all class sessions and to arrive before the beginning of class. That said, it is important to recognize that our normal attendance policies are not well suited to a pandemic. If you cannot attend class or arrive on time because of a personal illness, a family issue, jury duty, an athletic match, or a religious observance, you must contact me \textbf{beforehand} to let me know if at all possible. I define family issues broadly - if your family or friends become sick or are being affected by COVID-19 in other ways, please know that I want you to keep your focus on what is most important.

I may ask for more information, such as a note from a health care provider, a travel letter from Athletics, or other documentation for absences. I will not be asking for health care provider documentation for acute illnesses or injuries, though, since if you're sick but not \emph{very} sick, the last thing most you will want to do is go to a doctor just to get a note. I am proceeding with a spirit of trust in all of you, and ask you reciprocate that with me. If you need to modify assignment due dates, please let me know prior to those deadlines.

Please see the University's attendance policy for additional details.

\hypertarget{attendace-collection}{%
\subsection{Attendace Collection}\label{attendace-collection}}

In order to help identify students who might need extra support, I do keep track of who attends class. Attendance check-ins will be collected through a simple web-form. Students will need a QR code reader application installed on their smartphone to check-in if their phone does not support it automatically. The Course Docs contain some additional details and links for learning more about how this works.

This QR code will be available on-screen until I begin class. This means that you need to arrive to class at least a minute or two before we begin. If you arrive after the QR code has been taken down, I'll put it up again at the end of the ``front matter'' and ``back matter'' sections of the lecture slides. Attendance submissions must be received by the end of the class period.

These web forms are \textbf{time stamped}, so if you sign the form 3 minutes after the beginning of class or later, you will be marked as `late' in the attendance database. This is done automatically by my gradebook, so please see me if you have a concern about how this works or, more generally, if you have a concern about regularly being able to arrive to class on time.

If you do not own a smartphone, please let me know as soon as possible. You should note that attendance check-ins are covered by the course's Academic Honesty policy. Sharing the check-in form with another student or signing in on their behalf are both violations of this policy.

\hypertarget{zoom-policies}{%
\subsection{Zoom Policies}\label{zoom-policies}}

Since we are meeting virtually via Zoom, there are several additional policies to note:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Attending via Zoom is required. There is not an alternative means for completing this course. \emph{If you have a concern about technology, internet access, or other barriers to regularly attending class via Zoom, please let me know as soon as possible.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If there is a need for some or all of you to change from learning on-campus to learning from home or another location, we will work together to identify strategies for you to successfully complete the course.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Do not share Zoom details, including login information, links, and passwords, with anyone outside of this course.
\item
  Using your camera is \emph{strongly encouraged} during group discussions, but is not otherwise required.
\item
  Please keep your microphone muted unless you are actively speaking.
\item
  Class recordings will be made via Zoom and/or Panopto, and will be posted to Blackboard. Recordings should not be shared outside of class. They will capture whatever is happening on my screen, which may include sharing your name and whatever is actively shown via your webcam. \emph{If this presents a privacy concern for you, please let me know as soon as possible.}
\end{enumerate}

The Course Docs contain some additional tips for using Zoom. Please review them closely.

\hypertarget{covid-19-specific-policies}{%
\subsection{COVID-19 Specific Policies}\label{covid-19-specific-policies}}

The following COVID-19 specific policies apply to this course. In general, if you are sick but you feel well enough to attend class, you should continue to attend this class since we are meeting virtually. If you are sick and do not feel well enough to attend class, please let me know as soon as possible! As I have said previously, taking care of yourselves should be your first priority.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

  Students who exhibit any potential COVID symptoms (those that cannot be attributed to some other medical condition the students are known to have, such as allergies, asthma, etc.) shall absent themselves from any in-person class attendance or in-person participation in any class-related activity until they have been evaluated by a qualified medical official. Students should contact the University Student Health Center for immediate assistance.

  Students who exhibit any potential COVID symptoms (those that cannot be attributed to some other medical condition the students are known to have, such as allergies, asthma, etc.) but who feel well enough to a) attend the course synchronously in an online class session or b) participate in asynchronous online class activities, are expected to do so. Those who do not feel well enough to do so should absent themselves accordingly.
\item
  Students (whether exhibiting any of potential COVID symptoms or not, and regardless of how they feel) who are under either an isolation or quarantine directive issued by a qualified health official must absent themselves from all in-person course activity per the stipulations of the isolation or quarantine directive. They are expected to participate in synchronous or asynchronous online class activities as they feel able to do so, or absent themselves accordingly.

  As a temporary amendment to the current University Attendance Policy, all absences due to illness or an isolation/quarantine directive issued by a qualified health official shall be considered ``Authorized'' absences (effective August 2020 through May 2021).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{missed-classes}{%
\subsection{Missed Classes}\label{missed-classes}}

My priority with attendance is to identify students who may be struggling or in need of additional support. However, because attending class is crucial, I do factor attendance into your overall participation grade. In order to give you some flexibility, I do not apply any penalties to your first two unexcused absences. Any unexcused absences beyond those two will result in no credit (for an absences). Regular late arrivals may result in partial credit being earned for that day's participation grade.

Specific elements of the course, such as participation in group discussions during lectures as well as the QHQ discussions, will also be factored into your participation grade. If there is a need for you to miss a significant portion of your coursework, such as because of an illness, please reach out to me and we will make a plan for alternative ways to make-up these activities based on the circumstances.

It is your responsibility to make-up missed classes, including viewing the lecture recording and, if needed, obtaining notes from a classmate All lecture slides will be posted on Blackboard before class begins along with relevant notes for that lecture. Please note that lectures and discussions cannot be recorded by any means (e.g.~audio or video recordings, or photographs) without my permission.

\hypertarget{communication}{%
\section{Communication}\label{communication}}

Email is my preferred method of communication. I dedicate time to email responses each workday, meaning that my response time is typically within 24 hours during the workweek. If you have not received a response from me after 48 hours (or by end of business on Monday if you emailed me over the weekend), please feel free to follow-up with me.

Please use your SLU email account when emailing me. All messages regarding course updates, assignments, and changes to the class schedule including cancellations will be sent to your SLU email account. It is therefore imperative that you check your SLU email account regularly.

Please also ensure that all concerns or questions about your standing in the course are directed to me immediately. Inquires from parents, SLU staff members, and others will not be honored.

\hypertarget{electronic-devices}{%
\section{Electronic Devices}\label{electronic-devices}}

During class periods, students are asked to refrain from using electronic devices (including cell phones) for activities not directly related to the course. For this class, I expect students to limit their use of electronic devices to accessing Zoom, course readings, notes, and other course materials.

There is evidence that using electronic devices during lectures results in decreased retention of course content (\href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02940852}{Hembrooke and Gay 2003}) and lower overall course performance (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131506001436}{Fried 2008}). Students who are not using a laptop but are in direct view of another student's laptop also have decreased performance in courses (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512002254}{Sana et al.~2013}). Conversely, students who take notes the ``old fashioned way'' have better performance on tests compared to students who take notes on laptops (\href{http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614524581}{Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014}).

I therefore ask students to be conscious of how they are using their devices, the ways such use impacts their own learning, and the effect that it may have on others around them. I reserve the right to alter this policy if electronic device use becomes problematic during the semester.

\begin{rmdnote}
I \emph{strongly} encourage you to take notes for this course either on
a second device or by hand so that you can make the Zoom window as large
as possible. Please let me know by clicking ``slow down'' in Zoom's
attendee controls or let me know via the chat if you need something
repeated or clarified.

If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or lack a safe and stable place to live, you are urged to contact the \href{https://www.slu.edu/student-development/dean-of-students/index.php}{Dean of Students} for support. Likewise if you have concerns about your mental or physical health needs, or lack access to health care services you require, you should contact either the \href{https://www.slu.edu/student-development/dean-of-students/index.php}{Dean of Students}, \href{https://www.slu.edu/life-at-slu/student-health/index.php}{Student Health Services}, or the \href{https://www.slu.edu/life-at-slu/university-counseling/index.php}{University Counseling Center}.\footnote{This language is adopted from text written by \href{https://medium.com/@saragoldrickrab/basic-needs-security-and-the-syllabus-d24cc7afe8c9}{Dr.~Sarah Goldrick-Rab}.}

If you feel comfortable doing so, please discuss any concerns you might have with me. Doing so is particularly important if believe your performance in this course might be affected. I will do my best to work with you to come up with a plan for successfully completing the course and, if need be, work with you to identify on-campus resources. I will treat all discussions with discretion, though please be aware that certain situations, including disclosures of \href{/syllabus/harassment-and-title-ix.html}{sexual misconduct} or self harm, must be reported by faculty to the appropriate University office.

\hypertarget{academic-accommodations}{%
\subsection{Academic Accommodations}\label{academic-accommodations}}

If you meet the eligibility requirements for academic accommodations through the \href{https://www.slu.edu/life-at-slu/student-success-center/disability-services/index.php}{Office of Disability Services} (located within the Student Success Center) \emph{and you wish to use them for this class}, you should arrange to discuss your needs with me after the first class. All discussions of this nature are treated confidentially, and I will make every effort to work with you to come up with a plan for successfully completing the course requirements.

Please note that I will not provide accommodations to students who are not working with Disability Services, and that I cannot retroactively alter assignments or grades if they have already been completed. This follows the University policies on disability accommodations:

\begin{quote}
Students with a documented disability who wish to request academic accommodations must formally register their disability with the University. Once successfully registered, students also must notify their course instructor that they wish to use their approved accommodations in the course.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Please contact Disability Services to schedule an appointment to discuss accommodation requests and eligibility requirements. Most students on the St.~Louis campus will contact Disability Services, located in the Student Success Center and available by email at \href{mailto:Disability_services@slu.edu}{\nolinkurl{Disability\_services@slu.edu}} or by phone at 314-977-3484. Once approved, information about a student's eligibility for academic accommodations will be shared with course instructors by email from Disability Services and within the instructor's official course roster. Students who do not have a documented disability but who think they may have one also are encouraged to contact to Disability Services. Confidentiality will be observed in all inquiries.

\section{Academic Honesty}\label{academic-honesty}}

All students should familiarize themselves with \href{https://www.slu.edu/provost/policies/academic-and-course/policy_academic-integrity_6-26-2015.pdf}{Saint Louis University's policies} the the \href{https://www.slu.edu/arts-and-sciences/student-resources/academic-honesty.php}{College of Arts and Sciences policies} concerning cheating, plagiarism, and other academically dishonest practices:

\begin{quote}
Academic integrity is honest, truthful and responsible conduct in all academic endeavors. The mission of Saint Louis University is ``the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity.'' Accordingly, all acts of falsehood demean and compromise the corporate endeavors of teaching, research, health care, and community service through which SLU fulfills its mission. The University strives to prepare students for lives of personal and professional integrity, and therefore regards all breaches of academic integrity as matters of serious concern.
\end{quote}

Any work that is taken from another student, copied from printed material, or copied the internet without proper citation is expressly prohibited, and will be addressed by the instructor. Collaborating on quizzes, such as taking them in groups (whether in-person or virtually), is also prohibited. Any student who is found to have been academically dishonest in their work risks failing both the assignment and this course.

All relevant assignments should include in-text citations and references formatted using the \href{https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/583/1/}{American Sociological Association (ASA)} style guidelines.

\hypertarget{harassment-and-title-ix}{%
\section{Harassment and Title IX}\label{harassment-and-title-ix}}

While I have every expectation that each member of the Saint Louis University community is capable and willing to create a positive coursework experience, I fully recognize that there may be instances where students fall short of that expectation. Students should generally be aware that:

\begin{quote}
Saint Louis University prohibits harassment because of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status, military status, veteran status, gender expression/identity, genetic information, pregnancy, or any other characteristics protected by law.
\end{quote}

All students should also familiarize themselves with \href{http://www.slu.edu/general-counsel/institutional-equity-diversity/}{Saint Louis University's polices} on bias, discrimination, harassment, and sexual misconduct. In particular, they should be aware of policies on \href{http://www.slu.edu/general-counsel/institutional-equity-diversity/harassment.php}{harassment} and \href{https://www.slu.edu/about/safety/sexual-assault-resources.php}{sexual misconduct}:

\begin{quote}
Saint Louis University and its faculty are committed to supporting our students and seeking an environment that is free of bias, discrimination, and harassment. If you have encountered any form of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, stalking, domestic or dating violence, we encourage you to report this to the University. If you speak with a faculty member about an incident that involves a Title IX matter, that faculty member must notify SLU's Title IX Coordinator and share the basic facts of your experience. This is true even if you ask the faculty member not to disclose the incident. The Title IX Coordinator will then be available to assist you in understanding all of your options and in connecting you with all possible resources on and off campus.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Anna Kratky is the Title IX Coordinator at Saint Louis University (DuBourg Hall, Room 36; \href{mailto:anna.kratky@slu.edu}{\nolinkurl{anna.kratky@slu.edu}}; 314-977-3886). If you wish to speak with a confidential source, you may contact the counselors at the University Counseling Center at 314-977-TALK or make an anonymous report through SLU's Integrity Hotline by calling 1-877-525-5669 or online at \url{https://www.lighthouse-services.com/_StandardCustomURL/LHILandingPage.asp}.

\end{quote}

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported either directly to the instructor or to the University Administration. Consistent with the above policies, I will forward all reports of inappropriate conduct to the Title IX Coordinator's office or to the Office of Diversity and Affirmative Action. Please be aware that University policies may require me to forward information about the identity of any students connected to the disclosure.

Please also be aware that communications over various online services, including (but not limited to) Blackboard and Zoom, are covered by this policy.

\hypertarget{success-in-soc-1120}{%
\chapter{Success in SOC 1120}\label{success-in-soc-1120}}

Since this course will meet remotely for the entire semester, I have posted several articles on the Course Docs that include suggestions for navigating the course content, using Zoom, and using Blackboard. Please review these before the semester begins. Following these will be crucial for having a successful semester!

Students often ask me how to do well in various aspects of the course, and so I also have \emph{suggestions} for a successful semester. \emph{These observations are provided with no warranty} - following them does not guarantee any particular outcome. You could do everything in here and still do poorly in the course, and conversely you could ignore much of what is in discussed in the links below and still do well. However, \emph{most} of the students who are successful in this course will follow \emph{most} of these ideas consistently.

These tips are an effort to illuminate what sociologists refer to as the ``\href{https://books.google.com/books?hl=en\&lr=\&id=5r-TAgAAQBAJ\&oi=fnd\&pg=PP1\&dq=hidden+curriculum\#v=onepage\&q=hidden\%20curriculum\&f=false}{hidden curriculum}'' of higher education - there are things you need to do to be successful, but they are often unstated or not clearly communicated.

Since I give this advice out in multiple classes, the documents themselves are stored on my \href{https://chris-prener.github.io}{personal website}:

If there are other topics you have questions about, please let me know. These documents are a work in progress.

\begin{rmdnote}

\hypertarget{assignments-and-grading}{%
\chapter{Assignments and Grading}\label{assignments-and-grading}}

This section provides general details on the different types of assignments for this course. It also contains policies for submitting work, receiving feedback, and late work. A summary schedule with all due dates is available as part of the \href{course-schedule.html}{Course Schedule}.

\hypertarget{assignments}{%
\section{Assignments}\label{assignments}}

Your grade for this course will consist of a number of different assignments on which points may be earned. Each category of assignment is described below.

\begin{rmdwarning}
As a reminder, all due dates are provisional due to the uncertainty
around COVID-19 and how it will affect our semester. I will continually
update you during class and via Blackboard about the status of each
assignment's due dates as the semester progresses.
\end{rmdwarning}

\hypertarget{attendance-and-participation}{%
\subsection{Attendance and Participation}\label{attendance-and-participation}}

\begin{rmdtip}
Attendance and participation are worth 90 points, or \textbf{14.4\%} of
your final grade
\end{rmdtip}

As discussed above, both attendance and participation are important aspects of this class. The class participation grade will be based on (a) attendance, (b) level of engagement during class (including being present for and participating in course discussions), and (c) class ``entry'' and ``exit tickets.''

Each of these elements is assigned a point value and assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit (see \href{grading.html}{Grading}). Not attending class or completing an ``entry'' or ``exit'' ticket will result in no credit being earned for that element on a given day. Disengagement during class may result in partial or no credit being earned. Late arrivals will result in only partial credit earned for that element on a given day.

Your participation grade will be split, with 20 points for Part 1, 30 points each for Parts 2 and 3, and 10 points for Part 4. Since the number of points awarded for participation are variable, the total number of points earned for each half will be \textbf{weighted} so that it is converted to a final score that matches the points available for that part of the course. I provide the final number of points earned for each part of the course. If you would like a more detailed breakdown of your participation grade and/or attendance record, please reach out and I will happily provide one.

\hypertarget{theory-isnt-dead-posts}{%
\subsection{Theory Isn't Dead Posts}\label{theory-isnt-dead-posts}}

\begin{rmdtip}
Theory posts are worth 80 points, or \textbf{12.8\%} of your final grade
\end{rmdtip}

Over the course of the semester, there will be four short exercises that ask you to tie social theory, social science research, and current events together. For each of these assignments, I will post a news article. Based on your read of the article, you should pick one of the social theories we have discussed in class or in readings, briefly describe why you selected that theory (in 2-3 sentences), and then craft a theoretically motivated research question and hypothesis (a sentence each). Finally, you will briefly describe how you would propose to study this hypothesis (in 2-3 sentences). Your assignments will be posted to Blackboard before 5pm on the due date.

Once the due date has past, you will need to follow-up with two of your group members and provide a peer review of their proposal. These reviews should point out a strength of the theory that they selected as it relates to the article, and then raise one point that you think their theory selection may miss by providing an alternative theoretical perspective. These should be approximately 4-5 sentences in length. When responding, prioritize group members' posts that have not yet received any peer review. Reviews are due by the beginning of class on the follow-up due date.

Additional details and a sample assignment will be made available via Blackboard. Each Theory Post is worth 20 points, 15 for the written portion and 5 for the follow-up posts. Both elements will be assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit (see \href{grading.html}{Grading}).

Due dates for the Theory Post are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Theory Isn't Dead 1 - \textbf{Sunday, August 30\textsuperscript{th}}, with follow-ups due on \textbf{Tuesday, September 1\textsuperscript{st}}
\item
  Theory Isn't Dead 2 - \textbf{Sunday, September 20\textsuperscript{th}}, with follow-ups due on \textbf{Tuesday, September 22\textsuperscript{nd}}
\item
  Theory Isn't Dead 3 - \textbf{Sunday, November 1\textsuperscript{st}}, with follow-ups due on \textbf{Tuesday, November 3\textsuperscript{rd}}
\item
  Theory Isn't Dead 4 - \textbf{Sunday, November 22\textsuperscript{nd}}, with follow-ups due on \textbf{Tuesday, November 24\textsuperscript{th}}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{sociological-experiences}{%
\subsection{Sociological Experiences}\label{sociological-experiences}}

\begin{rmdtip}
Theory reflections are worth 80 points, or \textbf{12.8\%} of your final
grade
\end{rmdtip}

Over the course of the semester, there will be four short exercises that ask you to link data to your own personal experiences. Data for these exercises will be drawn primarily from Social Explorer, a tool that makes it easy to find demographic data about various places in the United States. These reflections should be approximately 1-2 paragraphs in length.

Additional details and a sample assignment will be made available via Blackboard. Each Sociological Experience is worth 20 points, and will be assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit (see \href{grading.html}{Grading}). Assignments are due by the beginning of class on the due date.

Due dates for the Sociological Experiences are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Sociological Experience 1 - High School - \textbf{Thursday, September 10\textsuperscript{th}}
\item
  Sociological Experience 2 - Socioeconomic Status - \textbf{Tuesday, September 29\textsuperscript{th}}
\item
  Sociological Experience 3 - Segregation - \textbf{Thursday, October 29\textsuperscript{th}}
\item
  Sociological Experience 4 - St.~Louis - \textbf{Thursday, November 12\textsuperscript{th}}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{qhq-papers}{%
\subsection{QHQ Papers}\label{qhq-papers}}

\begin{rmdtip}
QHQ Papers are worth 150 points, or \textbf{24\%} of your final grade
\end{rmdtip}

Each student will write a QHQ reflection paper on three chapters (one chapter per discussion period) of \emph{Mama Might Be Better Off Dead} (Abraham 1993). These reflection papers will integrate previous lecture material and readings to understand the cycle of events described in the book.

Additional details and a grading rubric will be available on Blackboard. QHQ Paper 1 is ungraded. If it is not turned in or not taking seriously, however, a deduction of 3\% will be applied to your final grade. QHQ Papers 2 and 3 each count for 75 points. Papers must be completed and submitted by the beginning of class on the date due.

Due dates for the QHQs are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  QHQ Paper 1 - \textbf{Thursday, October 1\textsuperscript{st}}
\item
  QHQ Paper 2 - \textbf{Tuesday, November 3\textsuperscript{rd}}
\item
  QHQ Paper 3 - \textbf{Tuesday, November 17\textsuperscript{th}}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{quizzes}{%
\subsection{Quizzes}\label{quizzes}}

\begin{rmdtip}
Quizzes are worth 150 points, or \textbf{24\%} of your final grade
\end{rmdtip}

Three non-cumulative multiple choice quizzes will be given throughout the semester. Each quiz will cover the breadth of the material in the course, including readings, lectures, and videos. Each quiz will consist of 30 multiple choice questions and will be worth 50 points. They will be administered via Blackboard. Quizzes must be taken between 7am CST and 10pm CST on the quiz date. They can be started at any point within that range, but once you begin the quiz, you will have only 35 minutes to complete it.

Quiz dates are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Quiz 1 - \textbf{Monday, September 14\textsuperscript{th}}
\item
  Quiz 2 - \textbf{Monday, October 12\textsuperscript{th}}
\item
  Quiz 3 - \textbf{Monday, November 23\textsuperscript{rd}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If the flex day on Tuesday, November 24\textsuperscript{th} is needed for instruction, this quiz will be rescheduled.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{final-project}{%
\subsection{Final Project}\label{final-project}}

\begin{rmdtip}
The Final Project is worth 75 points, or \textbf{12\%} of your final
grade
\end{rmdtip}

This project involves the creation of a single page handout that illustrates the origins of a health disparity present in American society. On the handout, you should provide some background information, data about the disparity, and connect the disparity to fundamental cause theory and/or the social determinants of health perspective. You have creative license to design the handout as you see fit, and should feel free to add graphs, maps, or photographs that help you illustrate the issues you are describing. The second page of the handout should contain a list of works cited. More details and a rubric will be provided on Blackboard. The final project will be due by \textbf{Monday, November 30\textsuperscript{th}.}

\hypertarget{submission-and-late-work}{%
\section{Submission and Late Work}\label{submission-and-late-work}}

\hypertarget{blackboard-submissions}{%
\subsection{Blackboard Submissions}\label{blackboard-submissions}}

All assignments must be submitted via Blackboard \emph{as a Word (\texttt{.doc} or \texttt{.docx}) file or a \texttt{.pdf} file} unless otherwise noted in the assignment instructions. Feedback will be returned to students via comments embedded in each document.

\hypertarget{late-work}{%
\subsection{Late Work}\label{late-work}}

Once the due date has passed, any assignments shared will be treated as late. Be advised that Blackboard time-stamps submissions, so that even being a few seconds over the due date and time will result in your assignment being marked late. Like arriving late to class, this happens automatically, so please let me know as soon as possible \textbf{before} a due date if you have a concern about a potentially late submission.

Assignments shared within 24-hours of the due date will have 15\% deducted from the grade. I will deduct 15\% per day for the next two 24-hour periods that assignments are late; after 72-hours, I will not accept late work. If you cannot submit work on time because of a personal illness, a family issue, jury duty, an athletic match, or a religious observance, you must contact me \emph{beforehand if at all possible} to discuss alternate submission of work. I may ask for more information, such as a note from a physician, a travel letter from Athletics, or other documentation for alternative deadlines.

\hypertarget{missed-quizzes}{%
\subsection{Missed Quizzes}\label{missed-quizzes}}

If you cannot attend an exam due to a personal illness, a family issue, jury duty, an athletic match, or a religious observance, you must contact me \textbf{beforehand} to discuss alternate quiz scheduling. I may ask for more information, such as a note from a physician, a travel letter from Athletics, or other documentation for rescheduled quizzes.

\hypertarget{extra-credit}{%
\section{Extra Credit}\label{extra-credit}}

From time to time I may offer extra credit to be applied to your final grade. I will only offer extra credit if it is open to the entire class (typically for something like attending a lecture or event on-campus). If I offer extra credit, I will generally require you to submit a short written summary of the activity within a week of the event to obtain the credit. Papers should be submitted via Blackboard and will typically consist of a paragraph describing the event and a paragraph connecting the event to the class material in some way. When offered, extra credit opportunities cannot be made-up or substituted if you are unable to attend the event.

\hypertarget{grading}{%
\section{Grading}\label{grading}}

All grades that use a ``check'' system (the Theory Isn't Dead and Sociological Experience assignments as well as ``entry'' and ``exit'' tickets) will be calculated using the following approach. A ``check-plus-plus'' represents exceptional work and will get full credit. A ``check-plus'' represents great work and will get 92\% of the points available for the assignment. A ``check'' represents satisfactory work and will get 85\% of the points available for that assignment. A ``check-minus'' represents work that needs substantial improvement and will get 75\% of the points available for that assignment. For other assignments, rubrics will be provided prior to the due date that break down how grading works.

I use a point system for calculating grades. The following table gives the weighting and final point totals for all assignments for this course:

All feedback will include grades that represent number of points earned. If you want to know your percentage on a particular assignment, divide the number of points earned by the number of points possible and then multiply it by 100.

Some of the provided rubrics on Blackboard result in final points for assignments that include decimals. In the event of non-standard decimals (those other than .25, .5, or .75), I will round your grade up to the next standard decimal value (e.g.~.25, .5, or .75).

\hypertarget{conflicting-or-incorrect-grades}{%
\subsection{Conflicting or Incorrect Grades}\label{conflicting-or-incorrect-grades}}

If you notice a discrepancy between the grade you received in the feedback and what appears on Blackboard, please let me know as soon as possible. I will default to taking the higher of the two grades as the official grade.

\hypertarget{letter-grades}{%
\subsection{Letter Grades}\label{letter-grades}}

letter grades will be calculated by taking the sum of all points earned and dividing it by the total number of points possible. This will be multiplied by 100 and then converted to a letter grade using the following table:

\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:unnamed-chunk-9}Course Grading Scale}

\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{lll}
\toprule
GPA & Letter & Percent\\
\midrule
4.0 & A & 93.0\% - 100\%\\
3.7 & A- & 90.0\% - 92.9\%\\
3.3 & B+ & 87.0\% - 89.9\%\\

1.0 & D & 63.0\% - 69.9\%\\
0.0 & F & < 63.0\%\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Updates to grades will be provided at midterms, and you can follow your progress via the \texttt{My\ Grades} area on Blackboard. I round-up final grades that are within a half percentage point of the next highest letter grade. Requests for final grade changes outside of this range will not be honored.

\begin{rmdwarning}
No chances will be given for revisions of poor grades. Incomplete grades
will be given upon request only if you have a ``C'' average and have
completed at least two-thirds of the possible points (412 points). You
should note that incomplete grades must be rectified by the specified
deadline or they convert to an ``F''. This policy reflects the
\href{https://catalog.slu.edu/academic-policies/academic-policies-procedures/incomplete-course/}{University's
policy on incomplete coursework}.
