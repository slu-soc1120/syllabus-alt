# Assignments and Grading
This section provides general details on the different types of assignments for this course. It also contains policies for submitting work, receiving feedback, and late work. A summary schedule with all due dates is available as part of the [Course Schedule](course-schedule.html).



## Assignments

Your grade for this course will consist of a number of different assignments on which points may be earned. Each category of assignment is described below. 

\begin{rmdwarning}
As a reminder, all due dates are provisional due to the uncertainty
around COVID-19 and how it will affect our semester. I will continually
update you during class and via Canvas about the status of each
assignment's due dates as the semester progresses.
\end{rmdwarning}

### Attendance and Participation

\begin{rmdtip}
Attendance and participation are worth 95 points, or \textbf{16.1\%} of
your final grade
\end{rmdtip}

As discussed above, both attendance and participation are important aspects of this class. The class participation grade will be based on (a) attendance, (b) level of engagement during class (including being present for and participating in course discussions), and (c) class "entry" and "exit tickets."

Each of these elements is assigned a point value and assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit (see [Grading](grading.html)). Not attending class or completing an "entry" or "exit" ticket will result in no credit being earned for that element on a given day. Disengagement during class may result in partial or no credit being earned. Late arrivals will result in only partial credit earned for that element on a given day.

Your participation grade will be split, with 20 points for Part 1, 30 points each for Parts 2 and 3, and 15 points for Part 4. Since the number of points awarded for participation are variable, the total number of points earned for each half will be **weighted** so that it is converted to a final score that matches the points available for that part of the course. I provide the final number of points earned for each part of the course. If you would like a more detailed breakdown of your participation grade and/or attendance record, please reach out and I will happily provide one.

### Theory Isn't Dead Posts

\begin{rmdtip}
Theory posts are worth 40 points, or \textbf{6.8\%} of your final grade
\end{rmdtip}

Over the course of the semester, there will be four short exercises that ask you to tie social theory, social science research, and current events together. For each of these assignments, I will post a news article. Based on your read of the article, you should pick one of the social theories we have discussed in class or in readings, briefly describe why you selected that theory (in 2-3 sentences), and then craft a theoretically motivated research question and hypothesis (a sentence each). Finally, you will briefly describe how you would propose to study this hypothesis (in 2-3 sentences). Your assignments will be posted to Canvas before 5pm on the due date.

Additional details and a sample assignment will be made available via Canvas. Each Theory Post is worth 20 points. Both elements will be assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit (see [Grading](grading.html)).

Due dates for the Theory Post are as follows:

  1. Theory Isn't Dead 1 - **Thursday, September 9**
  2. Theory Isn't Dead 2 - **Tuesday, October 5**

### Sociological Experiences

\begin{rmdtip}
Theory reflections are worth 80 points, or \textbf{13.6\%} of your final
grade
\end{rmdtip}

Over the course of the semester, there will be four short exercises that ask you to link data to your own personal experiences. Data for these exercises will be drawn primarily from <a href = "http://ezp.slu.edu/login?url=http://www.socialexplorer.com/ezproxy" target = "_blank">Social Explorer</a>, a tool that makes it easy to find demographic data about various places in the United States. These reflections should be approximately 1-2 paragraphs in length.

Additional details and a sample assignment will be made available via Canvas. Each Sociological Experience is worth 20 points, and will be assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit (see [Grading](grading.html)). Assignments are due by the beginning of class on the due date.

Due dates for the Sociological Experiences are as follows:

  1. Sociological Experience 1 - High School - **Tuesday, September 21**
  2. Sociological Experience 2 - Socioeconomic Status - **Tuesday, October 12**
  3. Sociological Experience 3 - Segregation - **Thursday, November 11**
  4. Sociological Experience 4 - St. Louis - **Thursday, December 2**

### *Mama* Papers

\begin{rmdtip}
QHQ Papers are worth 150 points, or \textbf{25.4\%} of your final grade
\end{rmdtip}

Each student will write a reflection paper on three chapters (one chapter per discussion period) of *Mama Might Be Better Off Dead* (Abraham 1993). These reflection papers will integrate previous lecture material and readings to understand the cycle of events described in the book. Additional details and a grading rubric will be available on Canvas. Papers must be completed and submitted by the beginning of class on the date due. Each paper is worth 50 points.

Due dates for the QHQs are as follows:

  1. *Mama* Paper 1 - **Thursday, October 14**
  2. *Mama* Paper 2 - **Thursday, November 18**
  3. *Mama* Paper 3 - **Tuesday, December 7**

### Quizzes

\begin{rmdtip}
Quizzes are worth 150 points, or \textbf{25.4\%} of your final grade
\end{rmdtip}

Three non-cumulative multiple choice quizzes will be given throughout the semester. Each quiz will cover the breadth of the material in the course, including readings, lectures, and videos. Each quiz will consist of 30 multiple choice questions and will be worth 50 points. They will be administered via Canvas. Quizzes must be taken between 7am CST and 10pm CST on the quiz date. They can be started at any point within that range, but once you begin the quiz, you will have only 45 minutes to complete it. Since they occur remotely, quizzes are open book and note.

Quiz dates are as follows:

  1. Quiz 1 - **Monday, September 27**
  2. Quiz 2 - **Monday, October 25**
  3. Quiz 3 - **Tuesday, December 14**
      * This is overlaps with our scheduled final exam time, so you can take the quiz during that period if you wish.

### Final Project

\begin{rmdtip}
The Final Project is worth 75 points, or \textbf{12.7\%} of your final
grade
\end{rmdtip}

This project involves the creation of a single page handout that illustrates the origins of a health disparity present in American society. On the handout, you should provide some background information, data about the disparity, and connect the disparity to fundamental cause theory and/or the social determinants of health perspective. You have creative license to design the handout as you see fit, and should feel free to add graphs, maps, or photographs that help you illustrate the issues you are describing. The second page of the handout should contain a list of works cited. More details and a rubric will be provided on Canvas. The final project will be due by **Tuesday, December 14**.

## Submission and Late Work

### Canvas Submissions

All assignments must be submitted via Canvas *as a `.pdf` file* unless otherwise noted in the assignment instructions. Feedback will be returned to students via comments embedded in each document.

### Late Work

Once the due date has passed, any assignments shared will be treated as late. Be advised that Canvas time-stamps submissions, so that even being a few seconds over the due date and time will result in your assignment being marked late. Like arriving late to class, this happens automatically, so please let me know as soon as possible **before** a due date if you have a concern about a potentially late submission. 

Assignments shared within 24-hours of the due date will have 15% deducted from the grade. I will deduct 15% per day for the next two 24-hour periods that assignments are late; after 72-hours, I will not accept late work. If you cannot submit work on time because of a personal illness, a family issue, jury duty, an athletic match, or a religious observance, you must contact me *beforehand if at all possible* to discuss alternate submission of work. I may ask for more information, such as a note from a physician, a travel letter from Athletics, or other documentation for alternative deadlines.

### Missed Quizzes

If you cannot attend an exam due to a personal illness, a family issue, jury duty, an athletic match, or a religious observance, you must contact me **beforehand** to discuss alternate quiz scheduling. I may ask for more information, such as a note from a physician, a travel letter from Athletics, or other documentation for rescheduled quizzes. 

## Extra Credit

From time to time I may offer extra credit to be applied to your final grade. I will only offer extra credit if it is open to the entire class (typically for something like attending a lecture or event on-campus). If I offer extra credit, I will generally require you to submit a short written summary of the activity within a week of the event to obtain the credit. Papers should be submitted via Canvas and will typically consist of a paragraph describing the event and a paragraph connecting the event to the class material in some way. When offered, extra credit opportunities cannot be made-up or substituted if you are unable to attend the event.

## Grading

All grades that use a “check” system (the Theory Isn't Dead and Sociological Experience assignments as well as "entry" and "exit" tickets) will be calculated using the following approach. A "check-plus-plus" represents exceptional work and will get full credit. A “check-plus” represents great work and will get 92% of the points available for the assignment. A “check” represents satisfactory work and will get 85% of the points available for that assignment. A “check-minus” represents work that needs substantial improvement and will get 75% of the points available for that assignment. For other assignments, rubrics will be provided prior to the due date that break down how grading works.

I use a point system for calculating grades. The following table gives the weighting and final point totals for all assignments for this course:

\begin{table}

\caption{(\#tab:unnamed-chunk-9)SOC 1120 Points Breakdown}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{llllll}
\toprule
Assignment & Period & Points & Quantity & Total & Percent\\
\midrule
Participation & Part 1 & 20 pts & x1 & 20 pts & 16.1\%\\
 & Part 2 & 30 pts & x1 & 30 pts & \\
 & Part 3 & 30 pts & x1 & 30 pts & \\
 & Part 4 & 15 pts & x1 & 15 pts & \\
Theory Isn't Dead &  & 20 pts & x2 & 40 pts & 6.8\%\\
\addlinespace
Sociological Experiences &  & 20 pts & x4 & 80 pts & 13.6\%\\
QHQs &  & 75 pts & x2 & 150 pts & 25.4\%\\
Quizzes &  & 50 pts & x3 & 150 pts & 25.4\%\\
Final Project &  & 75 pts & x1 & 75 pts & 12.7\%\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

All feedback will include grades that represent number of points earned. If you want to know your percentage on a particular assignment, divide the number of points earned by the number of points possible and then multiply it by 100.

Some of the provided rubrics on Canvas result in final points for assignments that include decimals. In the event of non-standard decimals (those other than .25, .5, or .75), I will round your grade up to the next standard decimal value (e.g. .25, .5, or .75).

### Conflicting or Incorrect Grades

If you notice a discrepancy between the grade you received in the feedback and what appears on Canvas, please let me know as soon as possible. I will default to taking the higher of the two grades as the official grade.

### Letter Grades

Letter grades will be calculated by taking the sum of all points earned and dividing it by the total number of points possible. This will be multiplied by 100 and then converted to a letter grade using the following table:

\begin{table}
\caption{(\#tab:unnamed-chunk-10)Course Grading Scale}

\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{lll}
\toprule
GPA & Letter & Percent\\
\midrule
4.0 & A & 93.0\% - 100\%\\
3.7 & A- & 90.0\% - 92.9\%\\
3.3 & B+ & 87.0\% - 89.9\%\\
3.0 & B & 83.0\% - 86.9\%\\
2.7 & B- & 80.0\% - 82.9\%\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{lll}
\toprule
GPA & Letter & Percent\\
\midrule
2.3 & C+ & 77.0\% - 79.9\%\\
2.0 & C & 73.0\% - 76.9\%\\
1.7 & C- & 70.0\% - 72.9\%\\
1.0 & D & 63.0\% - 69.9\%\\
0.0 & F & < 63.0\%\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Updates to grades will be provided at midterms, and you can follow your progress via the `My Grades` area on Canvas. I round-up final grades that are within a half percentage point of the next highest letter grade. Requests for final grade changes outside of this range will not be honored.

\begin{rmdwarning}
No chances will be given for revisions of poor grades. Incomplete grades
will be given upon request only if you have a ``C'' average and have
completed at least two-thirds of the possible points (412 points). You
should note that incomplete grades must be rectified by the specified
deadline or they convert to an ``F''. This policy reflects the
\href{https://catalog.slu.edu/academic-policies/academic-policies-procedures/incomplete-course/}{University's
policy on incomplete coursework}.
