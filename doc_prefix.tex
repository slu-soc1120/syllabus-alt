This is the hardcopy version of the \textbf{Fall 2021} syllabus.
\vspace{5mm}
\par \noindent This \texttt{.pdf} version of the course syllabus is automatically created as part of the document generation process. It is meant for students who wish to keep a hardcopy of the course policies and planned course schedule. \textbf{Since it is automatically created, it is not optimized for easy use} - readers may notice formatting inconsitencies and stray characters that are a result of the markdown to \LaTeX{} conversion process. The web version (located at \href{https://slu-soc1120.github/syllabus/}{https://slu-soc1120.github/syllabus/}) is meant to be the version of the syllabus used for everyday reference during the semester. As such, this \texttt{.pdf} version will not be updated as the semester progresses should any changes to the course schedule be necessary.
