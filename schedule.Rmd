### Scheduling Notes

The lecture schedule may change as it depends on the progress of the class. In the event of a cancellation due to weather or another disruption, I may alter the lecture schedule. The web version of this document will be updated to reflect any alterations, but the `.pdf` version will remain unaltered.
