# Course Schedule

The following is a high-level schedule that details the general topic covered by each module. Modules are collections of two or more lectures and class discussions under the broad headings provided below.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
schedule <- dplyr::tibble(
  Part = c("**1**", "1", "1", "**2**", "2", "2", "2", "**3**", "3", "3", "3", "**4**", "4"),
  Module = c("", "1", "2", "", "3", "4", "5", "", "6", "7", "8", "", "9"),
  `Planned Start Date` = c("", 
                           start_tbl$label[1], 
                           start_tbl$label[2],
                           "",
                           start_tbl$label[3],
                           start_tbl$label[4],

### Scheduling Notes

The course schedule may change as it depends on the progress of the class and the [challenges we are confronted by this semester](covid-19.html). The web version of this document will be updated to reflect any alterations, but the `.pdf` version will remain unaltered.

This semester, we will not have class on **October 28** and **November 25** because they fall on University breaks. Additionally, no class activities are scheduled for **October 26** or **November 23**. These are "flex days," which I have left without a scheduled plan to accommodate changes due to COVID-19. If we are approaching these dates without having had to use them, these will become days off from this course.
