Course Introduction
===================

\vspace{2mm}
*The function of sociology, as of every science, is to reveal that which
is hidden.*\
Pierre Bourdieu (1996)

\vspace{2mm}
Course Description
------------------

This course will survey the field of sociology, stressing important
ideas, methods, and results. We focus on health to illustrate the
application of sociological ideas. The survey is designed to develop
analytic thinking skills. Weekly readings from a text will be
supplemented with articles and chapters illustrating topical issues and
exercises on the skills and craft of the social sciences.

\vspace{3mm}
Course Objectives
-----------------

This course introduces the distinct sociological skills through the lens
of health and illness, including:

1.  The ability to recognize and examine social phenomena from multiple
    perspectives.

2.  The recognition of what constitutes fact based arguments from
    appropriately designed information gathering.

3.  The ability to understand the sources of attitudes and behaviors
    from cultures and structures and how they impact the quality of life
    of different groups in society.

4.  The ability to reflect on the diversity around us and to act in a
    moral and just manner as citizens of the world.

5.  Developing skills in independent thinking, aesthetic awareness,
    moral and/or ethical system of values, welcoming diversity, and
    committing to the value of life-long learning.

\vspace{3mm}
Cultural Diversity Core Requirement
-----------------------------------

This course fulfills the College of Arts and Sciences core requirement
for Cultural Diversity in the United States. The Cultural Diversity in
the United States requirement is designed to help students gain a better
understanding of the cultural groups in the United States and their
interactions. Students who complete a Cultural Diversity course in this
category will gain a substantial subset of the following skills:

1.  Analyze and evaluate how various underrepresented social groups
    confront inequality and claim a just place in society.

2.  Examine how conflict and cooperation between social groups shapes
    U.S. society and culture.

3.  Identify how individual and institutional forms of discrimination
    impact leaders, communities and community building through the
    examination of such factors as race, ethnicity, gender, religion,
    economic class, age, physical and mental capability, and sexual
    orientation.

4.  Evaluate how their personal life experiences and choices fit within
    the larger mosaic of U.S. society by confronting and critically
    analyzing their own values and assumptions about individuals and
    groups from different cultural contexts.

5.  Understand how questions of diversity intersect with moral and
    political questions of justice and equality.

\vspace{3mm}
Google Classroom
----------------

**[Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)** is a learning
management system like Blackboard, which you may be more familiar with.
There are two main areas - the 'Stream' and the 'About' tabs. The
'Stream' contains posts for announcements and assignments. Additions to
the 'Stream' should be emailed to your student e-mail account
automatically. This will be my primary means for communicating with the
class as a whole. Assignments posted to the 'Stream' allow you to submit
work for the course. You can use the 'Topics' on the left-hand menu of
the 'Stream' to filter posts.

\vspace{3mm}
Core Documents
--------------

There are two core documents for this course. This **Syllabus** sets out
core expectations and policies for the course. The **Reading List**
contains topics, required readings, and assignment due dates for each
week. These two documents spell out what is *required* for this course.
Both documents are available under the 'About' tab on **[Google
Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)**.

\vspace{3mm}
Readings
--------

There are two books required for this course. Each book has been
selected to correspond with one or more of the course objectives. The
books are:

1.  Abraham, Laurie K. 1993. *Mama Might Be Better Off Dead: The Failure
    of Health Care in Urban America*. Chicago, IL: The\
    University of Chicago Press. ISBN-13: 978-0226001395;\
    List Price: \$20.00; e-book versions available.

2.  Andersen, Margaret, Howard F. Taylor, and Kim A. Logio. 2016.
    *Sociology: The Essentials*. 9^th^ edition. Independence, KY:
    Cengage. ISBN-13: 978-1305503083; List Price: \$202.95; e-book
    versions available.

I do not require students to buy physical copies of texts. You are free
to select a means for accessing these texts that meets your budget and
learning style. If ebook editions (e.g. Kindle, iBooks, pdf, etc) of
texts are available, they are acceptable for this course. All texts
should be obtained in the edition noted above.

All readings are listed on the **Reading List** and should be completed
before the course meeting on the week in which they are assigned (unless
otherwise noted). Full text versions of most readings not found in the
books assigned for the course can be obtained using the library's
[Electronic Reserves](http://eres.slu.edu/eres/coursepass.aspx?cid=4443)
system. The password for the Electric Reserves will be posted on
**[Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)**.

Course Expectations and Policies
================================

General Expectations for Students
---------------------------------

My priority is that class periods are productive learning experiences
for all students. In order to foster this type of productive
environment, I ask students to follow a few policies:

1.  Arrive to class on time and stay for the entire class period.

2.  Silence *all* electronic devices before entering the classroom.

3.  Do not engage in side conversations. This is disrespectful to the
    speaker (whether me or a classmate), and can affect the ability of
    others in the class to learn.

4.  Be respectful of your fellow classmates. Do not interrupt when
    someone is speaking, monopolize the conversation, or belittle the
    ideas or opinions of others.

5.  Complete the assigned readings for each class in advance, and come
    prepared with discussion points and questions.

\vspace{3mm}
Course Content
--------------

This class covers topics that have a long history of divisiveness in the
United States. Students can expect to confront viewpoints that they may
disagree with or find contentious. I do not expect that students will
always agree with each other (or with me), and I encourage healthy
discussion and debate in class. However, I will insist that all such
conversations be conducted respectfully.

\vspace{3mm}
Attendance and Participation
----------------------------

Attendance and participation are important components of this course.
Students are expected to attend all class sessions. Making up missed
classes are your responsibility, including obtaining notes from a
classmate. I do post slides on **[Google
Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)**, but my slides are intended
only to serve as references. All lecture slides will be posted the week
after their use in class. Please note that lectures and discussions
cannot be recorded by any means (e.g. audio or video recordings, or
photographs) without my permission.

\vspace{3mm}
Communication
-------------

Email is my preferred method of communication. I dedicate time to email
responses each workday, meaning that my response time is typically
within 24 hours during the workweek. If you have not received a response
from me after 48 hours (or by end of business on Monday if you emailed
me over the weekend), please follow-up to ensure that your message did
not get lost in the shuffle.

Please use your SLU email account when emailing me. All messages
regarding course updates, assignments, and changes to the class schedule
including cancellations will be sent to your SLU email account. It is
imperative that you check your SLU email account regularly.

Please also ensure that all concerns or questions about your standing in
the course are directed to me immediately. Inquires from parents, SLU
staff members, and others will not be honored.

\vspace{3mm}
Electronic Devices
------------------

During class periods, students are asked to refrain from using
electronic devices (including cell phones) for activities not directly
related to the course. For this class, I expect students to limit their
use of electronic devices to accessing course readings, notes, and other
course materials.

There is evidence that using electronic devices during lectures results
in decreased retention of course content and lower overall course
performance. Students who are not using a laptop but are in direct view
of another student's laptop also have decreased performance in courses.
Conversely, students who take notes the "old fashioned way" have better
performance on tests compared to students who take notes on laptops.

I therefore ask students to be conscious of how they are using their
devices, the ways such use impacts their own learning, and the effect
that it may have on others around them. I reserve the right to alter
this policy if electronic device use becomes problematic during the
semester.

\vspace{3mm}
Student Support
---------------

If you meet the eligibility requirements for **academic accommodations**
through the Disability Services office (located within the Student
Success Center), you should arrange to discuss your needs with me after
the first class. All discussions of this nature are treated
confidentially, and I will make every effort to work with you to come up
with a plan for successfully completing the course requirements. Please
note that I will not provide accommodations to students who are not
working with Disability Services.

If you are a **student-athlete** who is in-season, you should discuss
your game schedule with me after the first class and share your travel
letter with me as soon as you have a copy. You are reminded that games
and tournaments are not excuses for failing to complete assignments, and
that NCAA rules prohibit student-athletes from missing classes for
practice. Low grades that jeopardize eligibility must be addressed
immediately by you, not by a coach or academic coordinator.

I also encourage you to take advantage of the **University Writing
Services (UWS) program**. Getting feedback benefits writers at all skill
levels and the quality of your writing will be reflected in assignment
grades. The UWS has trained writing consultants who can help you improve
the quality of your written work. UWS's consultants are available to
address everything from brainstorming and developing ideas to crafting
strong sentences and documenting sources.

\vspace{3mm}
Academic Honesty
----------------

All students should familiarize themselves with [Saint Louis
University's
policies](http://www.slu.edu/Documents/provost/academic_affairs/Academic%20Integrity%20Policy%20FINAL%20%206-26-15.pdf)
concerning cheating, plagiarism, and other academically dishonest
practices:

\vspace{3mm}
1cm *Academic integrity is honest, truthful and responsible conduct in
all academic endeavors. The mission of Saint Louis University is "the
pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of
humanity." Accordingly, all acts of falsehood demean and compromise the
corporate endeavors of teaching, research, health care, and community
service via which SLU embodies its mission. The University strives to
prepare students for lives of personal and professional integrity, and
therefore regards all breaches of academic integrity as matters of
serious concern.*

\vspace{3mm}
Any work that is taken from another student, copied from printed
material, or copied the internet without proper citation is expressly
prohibited. All relevant assignments should include in-text citations
and references formatted using the [American Sociological Association
(ASA)](http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/583/02/) or the
[American Psychological Association
(APA)](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/) style
guidelines. Any student who is found to have been academically dishonest
in their work risks failing both the assignment and this course.

\vspace{3mm}
Title IX
--------

All students should familiarize themselves with [Saint Louis
University's
polices](http://www.slu.edu/general-counsel-home/office-of-institutional-equity-and-diversity)
on bias, discrimination, and harassment:

\vspace{3mm}
1cm *Saint Louis University and its faculty are committed to supporting
our students and seeking an environment that is free of bias,
discrimination, and harassment. If you have encountered any form of
sexual misconduct (e.g. sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking,
domestic or dating violence), we encourage you to report this to the
University. If you speak with a faculty member about an incident of
misconduct, that faculty member must notify SLU's Title IX Coordinator,
Anna R. Kratky (DuBourg Hall, Room 36; <akratky@slu.edu>); 314-977-3886)
and share the basic facts of your experience with her. The Title IX
coordinator will then be available to assist you in understanding all of
your options and in connecting you with all possible resources on and
off campus.*

*If you wish to speak with a confidential source, you may contact the
counselors at the University Counseling Center at 314-977-TALK.*

\vspace{3mm}
Consistent with the above policy, I will forward all reports of
inappropriate conduct to the Title IX Coordinator's office. Please also
be aware that communications over various online systems, including (but
not limited to) **[Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)** and
Google Apps, are also covered by this policy.

Course Assignments and Grading
==============================

Assignments
-----------

##### Attendance and Participation (10%)

As discussed above, both attendance and participation are important
aspects of this class. The class participation grade will be based on
(a) attendance, (b) level of engagement during class, and (c) class
"entry" and "exit tickets".

Attendance check-ins will be collected either in-person or through a
simple web-form. Students will need a [QR
code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) reader application
installed on their smartphone to check-in. If you do not own a
smartphone, you will be able to sign-in with Chris before class.
Students should note that attendance check-ins are covered by the
course's Academic Honesty policy. Sharing the check-in form with another
student or signing in on their behalf are both violations of this
policy.

"Entry" and "exit" tickets will be collected via **[Google
Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)**. These will only be graded
for students who present in class on the day that they were collected.
Students without access to a smartphone or laptop should submit their
tickets as soon as possible after class on the days the tickets are
collected.

##### Sociological Experiences (10%)

Students will be required to complete two sociological experiences and
write a short response paper summarizing your own experience. Additional
details and a grading rubric are available on **[Google
Classroom's](https://classroom.google.com)** 'Stream' under the
'Assignments' topic. "The Bus" will be due on **February 12^th^** and
"The Suitcase" will be due on **March 28^th^**. Each reflection paper is
worth 5% of your final grade.

##### QHQ Papers (20%)

Each student will write a QHQ reflection paper on three chapters (one
chapter per discussion period) of *Mama Might Be Better Off Dead*
(Abraham 1993). These reflection papers will integrate previous lecture
material and readings to understand the cycle of events described in the
book. Additional details and a grading rubric are available on **[Google
Classroom's](https://classroom.google.com)** 'Stream' under the
'Assignments' topic. QHQ Paper 1 will be due on **February 28^th^**, QHQ
Paper 2 will be due on **April 11^th^**, and QHQ Paper 3 will be due on
**May 2^nd^**. QHQ Paper 1 is ungraded. If it is not turned in or not
taking seriously, however, a deduction of 3% will be applied to your
final grade. QHQ Papers 2 and 3 each count for 10% of your final grade.

##### Exams (60%)

Three non-cumulative multiple choice exams will be given throughout the
semester. Each exam will cover the breadth of the material in the
course, including readings, lectures, and videos. Exam 1 will be given
on **February 19^th^**, Exam 2 will be given on **April 4^th^**, and
Exam 3 will be given during our class's schedule final exam period on
**May 9^th^** from 2:00pm to 3:50pm. Each exam is worth 20% of your
final grade.

\vspace{3mm}
Submission and Late Work
------------------------

All assignments must be submitted via **[Google
Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)** *as a Google Doc file* unless
otherwise noted in the assignment instructions. **[Google
Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)** will have submission portals
for each assignment in the 'Stream' under the 'Assignments' topic.
Create your file in Google Docs and then use the submission portal to
submit the file. Once submitted, you will not be able to edit the file
again until it is returned with feedback and a grade. Feedback will be
returned to students via comments embedded in each Google Doc.

The Google Doc submission policy is in place because it facilitates
clear, easy grading that can be turned around to you quickly. Submitting
assignments in ways that deviate from this policy will result in a late
grade (see below) being applied in the first instance and a zero grade
for each subsequent instance.

Once the class begins, any assignments shared will be treated as late.
Assignments shared within 24-hours of the beginning of class will have
15% deducted from the grade. I will deduct 15% per day for the next two
24-hour periods that assignments are late; after 72-hours, I will not
accept late work. If you cannot attend class because of personal
illness, a family issue, jury duty, an athletic match, or a religious
observance, you must contact me beforehand to discuss alternate
submission of work. Internet or computer issues are not grounds for
missed deadlines.

\vspace{3mm}
Extra Credit
------------

From time to time I may offer extra credit to be applied to your final
grade. I will only offer extra credit if it is open to the entire class
(typically for something like attending a lecture or event on-campus).
If I offer extra credit, I will typically require you to submit a short
written summary of the activity within a week of the event to obtain the
credit. Papers should be submitted via **[Google
Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)**. When offered, extra credit
opportunities cannot be made-up or substituted if you are unable to
attend the event.

\vspace{3mm}
Grading
-------

Grades will be included with assignment feedback and will also be made
available through Blackboard's grade center. I use a point system for
calculating grades. The following table gives the weighting and final
point totals for all assignments for this course:\

to 1\
& & & &\
Attendance and Participation & 10% & 50 points & x1 & 50 points\
Sociological Experiences & 10% & 25 points & x2 & 50 points\
QHQ Papers & 20% & 50 points & x2 & 100 points\
Exams & 60% & 100 points & x3 & 300 points\
*Total* & 100% & & & 500 points\

\vspace{3mm}
I will return assignments with grades that represent number of points
earned. If you want to know your percentage on a particular assignment,
divide the number of points earned by the number of points possible and
then multiply it by 100.

Final grades will be calculated by taking the sum of all points earned
and dividing it by the total number of points possible (1,000). This
will be multiplied by 100 and then converted to a letter grade using the
following table:\

to 1\
& &\
4.0 & A & 93.0-100\
3.7 & A- & 90.0-92.9\
3.3 & B+ & 87.0-89.9\
3.0 & B & 83.0-86.9\
2.7 & B- & 80.0-82.9\
2.3 & C+ & 77.0-79.9\
2.0 & C & 73.0-76.9\
1.7 & C- & 70.0-72.9\
1.0 & D & 63.0-69.9\
0.0 & F & \< 63.0\

\vspace{3mm}
Incomplete grades will be given upon request only if you have a "C"
average and have completed at least two-thirds of the assignments. You
should note that incomplete grades must be rectified by the specified
deadline or they convert to an "F".

Scheduling Notes
----------------

In the event of a cancellation due to weather or another disruption, I
reserve the right to alter the weekly schedule or assignment deadlines.
