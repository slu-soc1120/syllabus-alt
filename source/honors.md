Students enrolled in the honors section are expected to complete all
readings and assignments included in the syllabus for and should look to

In-Depth Seminars
-----------------

You are expected to complete three seminars over the course of the
semester. The goal of the seminars is to go more in-depth on several
topics covered during the class and to provide an additional series of
venues to develop your analytical and communication skills. Each seminar
will consist of three interrelated parts:

1.  in-depth readings,

2.  a group seminar meeting, and

3.  a short response paper.

\vspace{3mm}
Seminar topics will be selected by the students as a group, and should
align with the topics listed below (see page ). Consensus on seminar
topics should be reached by class on Monday, January 22^nd^. All
students will complete the same seminars. Once the seminars are
selected, Chris will provide a list of additional journal articles and
book chapters to read. You will be expected to retrieve readings from
SLU's Library if they are available there. If they are not, Chris will
provide everyone with a `pdf` copy of the readings. Approximately 40 to
50 pages of additional reading per seminar should be expected.

We will schedule a when all students are available to meet together and
discuss the assigned readings. Each seminar meeting will occur after the
lectures on the seminar topic (ideally later that week or the next
week). Chris will coordinate scheduling the seminar meetings, which will
take place in one of the Sociology Department's conference rooms. You
should come to seminar meetings prepared to discuss the readings
themselves and draw analytical connections to the course material from
both the related week and prior weeks.

These discussions should inform a response paper written by each student
that connects a theme from the in-depth readings to the course as a
whole. The paper should be formatted using the following guidelines:

-   Times New Roman font

-   12 point font size

-   Double spaced

-   1" margins on top, bottom, and sides

-   Papers should be three pages in length

-   Papers should use in-text, parenthetical citations formatted using
    either ASA or APA

-   Papers should include a works cited section on a separate page that
    is properly formatted using ASA or APA

\vspace{3mm}
Paper due-dates will be a week after each seminar meeting, and papers
will be submitted via Google Classroom. Each response paper will be
graded on four elements:

1.  Content (25 points): How well does the paper synthesize information
    from the in-depth readings, other course readings, the course
    lectures, and other course resources such as documentaries (as
    appropriate).

2.  Organization (10 points): How well organized is the paper? Does it
    have an introduction, a conclusion, and a thesis?

3.  Writing (10 points): How well written is the paper? Is it free of
    spelling and grammatical errors?

4.  Citations (5 points): Are citations correctly applied?

Presentation
------------

You should pick a topic from the in-depth seminar topics list (see
below) that they would like to present on during one of the related
class lecture periods. Topic selection for this assignment can occur
independently of the selection of seminar topics, and no more than one
student can present on a single topic. Once you have settled on a topic,
let Chris know. Topics will be "reserved" on a first-come, first-served
basis.

With a topic in-hand, you should read ahead and pick *one narrow aspect*
of the readings that you want to learn more about and present on. You
are *strongly* encouraged to meet with Chris after selecting your narrow
focus area to make sure it is appropriate for the assignment. You should
complete additional background research on the topic, and put together
an (approximately) ten minute presentation that introduces students to
the area. Presentation is conceived of broadly here, and you should feel
free to search for creative ways to communicate your topic with the
class. Again, you are encouraged to meet with Chris to discuss this
aspect of the assignment.

Since presentation is conceived broadly, there is not a formal rubric
for this assignment. Students will be assessed holistically on how well
they communicate their topic to the class.
